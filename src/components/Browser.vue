The more I read it, the more marvellous it seemed. I pondered long on the meaning of his instructions when he gave it to me, and kept the manuscript some years, hesitating what to do with it.\r\n\r\nAt length I came to the conclusion knowing his idiosyncracy well, that his fear was only lest any one should know who the writer was; and feeling that it would be sinful to destroy such a history, I copied the manuscript and destroyed the original. He died relationless.\r\n\r\nNo one now can trace the author, no names are mentioned in the book, though they were given freely in the margin of his manuscript, and I alone know to whom the initials refer. If I have done harm in printing it, I have done none to him, have indeed only carried out his evident intention, and given to a few a secret history, which bears the impress of truth on every page, a contribution to psychology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n I began these memoirs when about twenty-five years old, having from youth kept a diary of some sort, which perhaps from habit made me think of recording my inner and secret life.\r\n\r\nWhen I began it, I had scarcely read a baudy book, none of which excepting \"Fanny Hill\" appeared to me to be truthful, that did, and it does so still; the others telling of recherche eroticisms, or of inordinate copulative powers, of the strange twists, tricks, and fancies, of matured voluptuousness, and philosophical lewdness, seemed to my comparative ignorance, as baudy imaginings, or lying inventions, not worthy of belief; although I now know by experience, that they may be true enough, however eccentric, and improbable, they may appear to the uninitiated.\r\n\r\nFanny Hill was a woman's experience. Written perhaps by a woman, where was a man's, written with equal truth? That book has no baudy word in it; but baudy acts need the baudy ejaculations; the erotic, full flavored expressions, which even the chastest indulge in, when lust, or love, is in its full tide of performance. So I determined to write my private life freely as to fact, and in the spirit of the lustful acts done by me, or witnessed; it is written therefore with absolute truth, and without any regard whatever for what the world calls decency. Decency and voluptuousness in its fullest acceptance, cannot exist together, one would kill the other; the poetry of copulation I have only experienced with a few women, which however neither prevented them, nor me from calling a spade, a spade.\r\n\r\nI began it for my amusement; when many years had been chronicled I tired of it and ceased. Some ten years afterwards I met a woman, with whom, or with those she helped me do; I did, said, saw, and heard, well nigh everything a man and woman could do with their genitals, and began to narrate those events, when quite fresh in my memory, a great variety of incidents extending over four years or more. Then I lost sight of her, and my amorous amusements for a while were simpler, but that part of my history was complete.\r\n\r\nAfter a little while, I set to work to describe the events of the intervening years of my youth, and early middle age; which included most of my gallant intrigues and adventures of a frisky order; but not the more lascivious ones of later years. Then an illness caused me to think seriously of burning the whole. But not liking to destroy my labor, I laid it aside again for a couple of years. Then another illness gave me long uninterrupted leisure; I read my manuscript, and filled in some occurrences which I had forgotten, but which my diary enabled me to place in their proper order. This will account for the difference in style in places, which I now observe; and a very needless repetition, of voluptuous descriptions, which I had forgotten, had been before described; that however is inevitable, for human copulation, vary the incidents leading up to it as you may, is, and must be, at all times, much the same affair.\r\n\r\nThen for the first time, I thought I would print my work that had been commenced more than twenty years before, but hesitated. I then had entered my maturity, and on to the most lascivious portion of my life, the events were disjointed, and fragmentary and my amusement was to describe them just after they occurred. Most frequently the next day I wrote all down with much prolixity, since, I have much abbreviated it.\r\n\r\nI had from youth an excellent memory, but about sexual matters a wonderful one. Women were the pleasure of my life. I loved cunt, but also she who had it; I like the woman I fucked and not simply the cunt I fucked, and therein is a great difference. I recollect even now in a degree which astonishes me, the face, color, stature, thighs, backside, and cunt, of well nigh every woman I have had, who was not a mere casual; and even of some who were. The clothes they wore, the houses and rooms in which I had them, were before me mentally, as I wrote, the way the bed, and furniture were placed, the side of the room the windows were on, I remembered perfectly; and all the important events I can fix as to time, sufficiently nearly by reference to my diary, in which the contemporaneous circumstances of my life are recorded.\r\n\r\nI recollect also largely what we said, and did, and generally our baudy amusements. Where I fail to have done so, I have left description blank, rather than attempt to make a story coherent by inserting what was merely probable. I could not now account for my course of action, nor why I did this, or said that, my conduct seems strange, foolish, absurd, very frequently, that of some women, equally so, but I can but state what did occur.\r\n\r\nIn a few cases, I have for what ev","extract":" had been at school and college together, and our intimacy had never been broken.

The Period\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the best of times,\r\nit was the worst of times,\r\nit was the age of wisdom,\r\nit was the age of foolishness,\r\nit was the epoch of belief,\r\nit was the epoch of incredulity,\r\nit was the season of Light,\r\nit was the season of Darkness,\r\nit was the spring of hope,\r\nit was the winter of despair,\r\nwe had everything before us,\r\nwe had nothing before us,\r\nwe were all going direct to Heaven,\r\nwe were all going direct the other way--\r\nin short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of\r\nits noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for\r\nevil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.\r\n\r\nThere were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the\r\nthrone of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with\r\na fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer\r\nthan crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes,\r\nthat things in general were settled for ever.\r\n\r\nIt was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.\r\nSpiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period,\r\nas at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth\r\nblessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had\r\nheralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were\r\nmade for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane\r\nghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its\r\nmessages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally\r\ndeficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the\r\nearthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People,\r\nfrom a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange\r\nto relate, have proved more important to the human race than any\r\ncommunications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane\r\nbrood.\r\n\r\nFrance, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her\r\nsister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down\r\nhill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her\r\nChristian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane\r\nachievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue\r\ntorn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not\r\nkneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks\r\nwhich passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty\r\nyards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and\r\nNorway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death,\r\nalready marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into\r\nboards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in\r\nit, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses\r\nof some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were\r\nsheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with\r\nrustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which\r\nthe Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of\r\nthe Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work\r\nunceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about\r\nwith muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion\r\nthat they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.\r\n\r\nIn England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to\r\njustify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and\r\nhighway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night;\r\nfamilies were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing\r\ntheir furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the highwayman\r\nin the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and\r\nchallenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of\r\n“the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the\r\nmail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and\r\nthen got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the\r\nfailure of his ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace;\r\nthat magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand\r\nand deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the\r\nillustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; p","extract":"udith Boss\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TALE OF TWO CITIES\r\n\r\nA STORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nBy Charles Dickens\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n     Book the First--Recalled to Life\r\n\r\n     Chapter I      The Period\r\n     Chapter II     The Mail\r\n     Chapter III    The Night Shadows\r\n     Chapter IV     The Preparation\r\n     Chapter V      The Wine-shop\r\n     Chapter VI     The Shoemaker\r\n\r\n\r\n     Book the Second--the Golden Thread\r\n\r\n     Chapter I      Five Years Later\r\n     Chapter II     A Sight\r\n     Chapter III    A Disappointment\r\n     Chapter IV     Congratulatory\r\n     Chapter V      The Jackal\r\n     Chapter VI     Hundreds of People\r\n     Chapter VII    Monseigneur in Town\r\n    "},"matches":[{"value":"udith Boss\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TALE OF TWO CITIES\r\n\r\nA STORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nBy Charles Dickens\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n     Book the First--Recalled to Life\r\n\r\n     Chapter I      The Period\r\n     Chapter II     The Mail\r\n     Chapter III    The Night Shadows\r\n     Chapter IV     The Preparation\r\n     Chapter V      The Wine-shop\r\n     Chapter VI     The Shoemaker\r\n\r\n\r\n     Book the Second--the Golden Thread\r\n\r\n     Chapter I      Five Years Later\r\n     Chapter II     A Sight\r\n     Chapter III    A Disappointment\r\n     Chapter IV     Congratulatory\r\n     Chapter V      The Jackal\r\n     Chapter VI     Hundreds of People\r\n     Chapter VII    Monseigneur in Town\r\n    ","key":"extract","arrayIndex":0,"higlights":"udith Boss\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TALE OF TWO CITIES\r\n\r\nA STORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nBy Charles Dickens\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n     Book the First--Recalled to Life\r\n\r\n     Chapter I      The Period\r\n     Chapter II     The Mail\r\n     Chapter III    The Night Shadows\r\n     Chapter IV     The Preparation\r\n     Chapter V      The Wine-shop\r\n     Chapter VI     The Shoemaker\r\n\r\n\r\n     Book the Second--the Golden Thread\r\n\r\n     Chapter I      Five Years Later\r\n     Chapter II     A Sight\r\n     Chapter III    A Disappointment\r\n     Chapter IV     Congratulatory\r\n     Chapter V      The Jackal\r\n     Chapter VI     <em>Hu</em>ndreds of People\r\n     Chapter VII    Monseigneur in Town\r\n    "}],"score":0.4004},{"item":{"author":"Dickens, Charles, 1812-1870","title":"A Christmas Carol in Prose; Being a Ghost Story of Christmas","language":"English","subject":"Scrooge, Ebenezer (Fictitious character) -- Fiction","id":"46","downloads":"7943 downloads in the last 30 days.","book":"PROSE\r\nBEING\r\nA Ghost Story of Christmas\r\n\r\nby Charles Dickens\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nI HAVE endeavoured in this Ghostly little book,\r\nto raise the Ghost of an Idea, which shall not put my\r\nreaders out of humour with themselves, with each other,\r\nwith the season, or with me.

There is no doubt\r\nwhatever about that. The register of his burial was\r\nsigned by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker,\r\nand the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and\r\nScrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for anything he\r\nchose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a\r\ndoor-nail.\r\n\r\nMind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my\r\nown knowledge, what there is particularly dead about\r\na door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to\r\nregard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery\r\nin the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors\r\nis in the simile; and my unhallowed hands\r\nshall not disturb it, or the Country's done for. You\r\nwill therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that\r\nMarley was as dead as a door-nail.\r\n\r\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did.\r\nHow could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were\r\npartners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge\r\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole\r\nassign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and\r\nsole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully\r\ncut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent\r\nman of business on the very day of the funeral,\r\nand solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.\r\n\r\nThe mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to\r\nthe point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley\r\nwas dead. This must be distinctly understood, or\r\nnothing wonderful can come of the story I am going\r\nto relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that\r\nHamlet's Father died before the play began, there\r\nwould be nothing more remarkable in his taking a\r\nstroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\r\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged\r\ngentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy\r\nspot--say Saint Paul's Churchyard for instance--\r\nliterally to astonish his son's weak mind.\r\n\r\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley's name.\r\nThere it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse\r\ndoor: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as\r\nScrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the\r\nbusiness called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley,\r\nbut he answered to both names. It was all the\r\nsame to him.\r\n\r\nOh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone,\r\nScrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping,\r\nclutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint,\r\nfrom which no steel had ever struck out generous fire;\r\nsecret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The\r\ncold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed\r\nnose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his\r\neyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his\r\ngrating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his\r\neyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low\r\ntemperature always about with him; he iced his office in\r\nthe dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.\r\n\r\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on\r\nScrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather\r\nchill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he,\r\nno falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no\r\npelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't\r\nknow where to have him. The heaviest rain, and\r\nsnow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage\r\nover him in only one respect. They often \"came down\"\r\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\r\n\r\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with\r\ngladsome looks, \"My dear Scrooge, how are you?\r\nWhen will you come to see me?\" No beggars implored\r\nhim to bestow a trifle, no children asked him\r\nwhat it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all\r\nhis life inquired the way to such and such a place, of\r\nScrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to\r\nknow him; and when they saw him coming on, would\r\ntug their owners into doorways and up courts; and\r\nthen would wag their tails as though they said, \"No\r\neye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\"\r\n\r\nBut what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing\r\nhe liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths\r\nof life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance,\r\nwas what the knowing ones call \"nuts\" to Scrooge.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year,\r\non Christmas Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his\r\ncounting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy\r\nwithal: and he could hear the people in the court outside,\r\ngo wheezing up and down, beating their hands\r\nupon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the\r\npavement stones to warm them. The city clocks had\r\nonly just gone three, but it was quite dark already--\r\nit had not been light all day--and candles were flaring\r\nin the windows of the neighbouring offices, like\r\nruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog\r\ncame pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was\r\nso dense without, that although the court was of the\r\nnarrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms.\r\nTo see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring\r\neverything, one might have thought that Nature\r\nlived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.\r\n\r\nThe door of Scrooge's counting-house was open\r\nthat he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a\r\ndismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying\r\nletters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's\r\nfire was so very much smaller that it looked like one\r\ncoal. But he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept\r\nthe coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the\r\nclerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted\r\nthat it would be necessary for them to part.

Marseilles—The Arrival\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde\r\nsignalled the three-master, the Pharaon from Smyrna, Trieste, and\r\nNaples.\r\n\r\nAs usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Château d’If,\r\ngot on board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island.\r\n\r\nImmediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean\r\nwere covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a\r\nship to come into port, especially when this ship, like the Pharaon, has\r\nbeen built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs to an\r\nowner of the city.\r\n\r\nThe ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic\r\nshock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled\r\nPomègue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker, but\r\nso slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is the\r\nforerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have\r\nhappened on board. However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly\r\nthat if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself, for\r\nshe bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the\r\nanchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by\r\nthe side of the pilot, who was steering the Pharaon towards the narrow\r\nentrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity and\r\nvigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each\r\ndirection of the pilot.\r\n\r\nThe vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much\r\naffected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the\r\nvessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled\r\nalongside the Pharaon, which he reached as she rounded into La Réserve\r\nbasin.\r\n\r\nWhen the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his\r\nstation by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship’s bulwarks.\r\n\r\nHe was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with black\r\neyes, and hair as dark as a raven’s wing; and his whole appearance\r\nbespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from\r\ntheir cradle to contend with danger.\r\n\r\n“Ah, is it you, Dantès?” cried the man in the skiff. “What’s the matt","extract":", and\r\nDavid Widger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO\r\n\r\n\r\nby Alexandre Dumas [père]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n0009m\r\n\r\n\r\n0011m\r\n\r\n\r\n0019m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContents\r\n\r\nVOLUME ONE\r\n\r\nChapter 1.

Allez vous-en! Sapristi! That's all right!”\r\n\r\nHe could speak a little Spanish, and also a language which nobody\r\nunderstood, unless it was the mocking-bird that hung on the other\r\nside of the door, whistling his fluty notes out upon the breeze with\r\nmaddening persistence.\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier, unable to read his newspaper with any degree of comfort,\r\narose with an expression and an exclamation of disgust.\r\n\r\nHe walked down the gallery and across the narrow “bridges” which\r\nconnected the Lebrun cottages one with the other. He had been seated\r\nbefore the door of the main house. The parrot and the mockingbird were\r\nthe property of Madame Lebrun, and they had the right to make all the\r\nnoise they wished. Mr. Pontellier had the privilege of quitting their\r\nsociety when they ceased to be entertaining.\r\n\r\nHe stopped before the door of his own cottage, which was the fourth one\r\nfrom the main building and next to the last. Seating himself in a wicker\r\nrocker which was there, he once more applied himself to the task of\r\nreading the newspaper. The day was Sunday; the paper was a day old. The\r\nSunday papers had not yet reached Grand Isle. He was already acquainted\r\nwith the market reports, and he glanced restlessly over the editorials\r\nand bits of news which he had not had time to read before quitting New\r\nOrleans the day before.\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier wore eye-glasses. He was a man of forty, of medium height\r\nand rather slender build; he stooped a little. His hair was brown and\r\nstraight, parted on one side. His beard was neatly and closely trimmed.\r\n\r\nOnce in a while he withdrew his glance from the newspaper and looked\r\nabout him. There was more noise than ever over at the house. The main\r\nbuilding was called “the house,” to distinguish it from the cottages.\r\nThe chattering and whistling birds were still at it. Two young girls,\r\nthe Farival twins, were playing a duet from “Zampa” upon the piano.\r\nMadame Lebrun was bustling in and out, giving orders in a high key to a\r\nyard-boy whenever she got inside the house, and directions in an equally\r\nhigh voice to a dining-room servant whenever she got outside. She was\r\na fresh, pretty woman, clad always in white with elbow sleeves. Her\r\nstarched skirts crinkled as she came and went. Farther down, before\r\none of the cottages, a lady in black was walking demurely up and down,\r\ntelling her beads. A good many persons of the pension had gone over to\r\nthe Cheniere Caminada in Beaudelet's lugger to hear mass. Some young\r\npeople were out under the wateroaks playing croquet. Mr. Pontellier's\r\ntwo children were there--sturdy little fellows of four and five. A\r\nquadroon nurse followed them about with a faraway, meditative air.\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier finally lit a cigar and began to smoke, letting the paper\r\ndrag idly from his hand. He fixed his gaze upon a white sunshade that\r\nwas advancing at snail's pace from the beach. He could see it plainly\r\nbetween the gaunt trunks of the water-oaks and across the stretch of\r\nyellow camomile. The gulf looked far away, melting hazily into the blue\r\nof the horizon. The sunshade continued to approach slowly. Beneath its\r\npink-lined shelter were his wife, Mrs. Pontellier, and young Robert\r\nLebrun. When they reached the cottage, the two seated themselves with\r\nsome appearance of fatigue upon the upper step of the porch, facing each\r\nother, each leaning against a supporting post.\r\n\r\n“What folly! to bathe at such an hour in such heat!” exclaimed Mr.\r\nPontellier. He himself had taken a plunge at daylight. That was why the\r\nmorning seemed long to him.\r\n\r\n“You are burnt beyond recognition,” he added, looking at his wife as one\r\nlooks at a valuable piece of personal property which has suffered some\r\ndamage. She held up her hands, strong, shapely hands, and surveyed them\r\ncritically, drawing up her fawn sleeves above the wrists. Looking at\r\nthem reminded her of her rings, which she had given to her husband\r\nbefore leaving for the beach. She silently reached out to him, and he,\r\nunderstanding, took the rings from his vest pocket and dropped them\r\ninto her open palm. She slipped them upon her fingers; then clasping\r\nher knees, she looked across at Robert and began to laugh. The rings\r\nsparkled upon her fingers. He sent back an answering smile.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked Pontellier, looking lazily and amused from one to\r\nthe other. It was some utter nonsense; some adventure out there in the\r\nwater, and they both tried to relate it at once. It did not seem half\r\nso amusing when told. They realized this, and so did Mr. Pontellier. He\r\nyawned and stretched himself. Then he got up, saying he had half a mind\r\nto go over to Klein's hotel and play a game of billiards.\r\n\r\n“Come go along, Lebrun,” he proposed to Robert. But Robert admitted\r\nquite frankly that he preferred to stay where he was and talk to Mrs.\r\nPontellier.\r\n\r\n“Well, send him about his business when he bores you, Edna,” instructed\r\nher husband as he prepared to leave.\r\n\r\n“Here, take the umbrella,” she exclaimed, holding it out to him. He\r\naccepted the sunshade, and lifting it over his head descended the steps\r\nand walked away.\r\n\r\n“Coming back to dinner?” his wife called after him. He halted a moment\r\nand shrugged his shoulders. He felt in his vest pocket; there was a\r\nten-dollar bill there. He did not know; perhaps he would return for the\r\nearly dinner and perhaps he would not. It all depended upon the company\r\nwhich he found over at Klein's and the size of “the game.” He did not\r\nsay this, but she understood it, and laughed, nodding good-by to him.\r\n\r\nBoth children wanted to follow their father when they saw him starting\r\nout. He kissed them and promised to bring them back bonbons and peanuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Pontellier's eyes were quick and bright; they were a yellowish\r\nbrown, about the color of her hair.

JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE ***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE\r\n\r\nby Robert Louis Stevenson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORY OF THE DOOR\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was never\r\nlighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse; backward\r\nin sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow lovable.\r\nAt friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste, something\r\neminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which never\r\nfound its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these silent\r\nsymbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in the acts\r\nof his life. He was austere with himself; drank gin when he was alone,\r\nto mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the theatre, had\r\nnot crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he had an approved\r\ntolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with envy, at the high\r\npressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and in any extremity\r\ninclined to help rather than to reprove. “I incline to Cain’s heresy,”\r\n he used to say quaintly: “I let my brother go to the devil in his own\r\nway.” In this character, it was frequently his fortune to be the last\r\nreputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives of\r\ndowngoing men. And to such as these, so long as they came about his\r\nchambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative\r\nat the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar\r\ncatholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to accept his\r\nfriendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that was\r\nthe lawyer’s way. His friends were those of his own blood or those whom\r\nhe had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the growth of\r\ntime, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt the\r\nbond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman, the\r\nwell-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for many, what these\r\ntwo could see in each other, or what subject they could find in common.\r\nIt was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday walks,\r\nthat they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail with\r\nobvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two men put\r\nthe greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief jewel\r\nof each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but\r\neven resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them\r\nuninterrupted.\r\n\r\nIt chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a\r\nby-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what\r\nis called quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The\r\ninhabitants were all doing well, it seemed and all emulously hoping to\r\ndo better still, and laying out the surplus of their grains in coquetry;\r\nso that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of\r\ninvitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday, when it\r\nveiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage,\r\nthe street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a\r\nfire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters, well-polished\r\nbrasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught\r\nand pleased the eye of the passenger.\r\n\r\nTwo doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was\r\nbroken by the entry of a court; and just at that point a certain\r\nsinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street. It\r\nwas two storeys high; showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower\r\nstorey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper; and bore\r\nin every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence. The\r\ndoor, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered\r\nand distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on the\r\npanels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had tried\r\nhis knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one had\r\nappeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their ravages.\r\n\r\nMr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; but\r\nwhen they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane and\r\npointed.\r\n\r\n“Did you ever remark that door?” he asked; and when his companion had\r\nreplied in the affirmative. “It is connected in my mind,” added he,\r\n“with a very odd story.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” said Mr. Utterson, with a slight change of voice, “and what\r\nwas that?”\r\n\r\n“Well, it was this way,” returned Mr. Enfield: “I was coming home from\r\nsome place at the end of the world, about three o’clock of a black\r\nwinter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was\r\nliterally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street and all the\r\nfolks asleep--street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession\r\nand all as empty as a church--till at last I got into that state of mind\r\nwhen a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a\r\npoliceman. All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was\r\nstumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe\r\neight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross\r\nstreet. Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at\r\nthe corner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man\r\ntrampled calmly over the child’s body and left her screaming on the\r\nground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It wasn’t\r\nlike a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut.

The winged fairies of Grimm and Andersen have brought more\r\nhappiness to childish hearts than all other human creations.\r\n\r\nYet the old time fairy tale, having served for generations, may now be\r\nclassed as \"historical\" in the children's library; for the time has\r\ncome for a series of newer \"wonder tales\" in which the stereotyped\r\ngenie, dwarf and fairy are eliminated, together with all the horrible\r\nand blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a\r\nfearsome moral to each tale.  Modern education includes morality;\r\ntherefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales\r\nand gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident.\r\n\r\nHaving this thought in mind, the story of \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\"\r\nwas written solely to please children of today.  It aspires to being a\r\nmodernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and\r\nthe heartaches and nightmares are left out.\r\n\r\n\r\nL. Frank Baum\r\n\r\nChicago, April, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  The Cyclone\r\n\r\n\r\nDorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle\r\nHenry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife.  Their\r\nhouse was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon\r\nmany miles.  There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one\r\nroom; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for\r\nthe dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds.  Uncle Henry\r\nand Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in\r\nanother corner.  There was no garret at all, and no cellar--except a\r\nsmall hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family\r\ncould go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to\r\ncrush any building in its path.  It was reached by a trap door in the\r\nmiddle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark\r\nhole.\r\n\r\nWhen Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see\r\nnothing but the great gray prairie on every side.  Not a tree nor a\r\nhouse broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of\r\nthe sky in all directions.  The sun had baked the plowed land into a\r\ngray mass, with little cracks running through it.  Even the grass was\r\nnot green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until\r\nthey were the same gray color to be seen everywhere.  Once the house\r\nhad been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed\r\nit away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.\r\n\r\nWhen Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife.  The sun\r\nand wind had changed her, too.  They had taken the sparkle from her\r\neyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks\r\nand lips, and they were gray also.  She was thin and gaunt, and never\r\nsmiled now.  When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt\r\nEm had been so startled by the child's laughter that she would scream\r\nand press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy's merry voice\r\nreached her ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder\r\nthat she could find anything to laugh at.\r\n\r\nUncle Henry never laughed.  He worked hard from morning till night and\r\ndid not know what joy was.  He was gray also, from his long beard to\r\nhis rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.\r\n\r\nIt was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray\r\nas her other surroundings.  Toto was not gray; he was a little black\r\ndog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on\r\neither side of his funny, wee nose.  Toto played all day long, and\r\nDorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.\r\n\r\nToday, however, they were not playing.  Uncle Henry sat upon the\r\ndoorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than\r\nusual.  Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at\r\nthe sky too.  Aunt Em was washing the dishes.\r\n\r\nFrom the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry\r\nand Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the\r\ncoming storm.  There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the\r\nsouth, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the\r\ngrass coming from that direction also.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Uncle Henry stood up.\r\n\r\n\"There's a cyclone coming, Em,\" he called to his wife.  \"I'll go look\r\nafter the stock.\"  Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and\r\nhorses were kept.\r\n\r\nAunt Em dropped her work and came to the door.  One glance told her of\r\nthe danger close at hand.\r\n\r\n\"Quick, Dorothy!\" she screamed.  \"Run for the cellar!\"\r\n\r\nToto jumped out of Dorothy's arms and hid under the bed, and the girl\r\nstarted to get him.  Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the trap\r\ndoor in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark\r\nhole.  Dorothy caught Toto at last and started to follow her aunt.\r\nWhen she was halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the\r\nwind, and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat\r\ndown suddenly upon the floor.\r\n\r\nThen a strange thing happened.\r\n\r\nThe house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the\r\nair.  Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.\r\n\r\nThe north and south winds met where th","extract":"\n   2.  The Council with the Munchkins\r\n   3.

This name was given, we are told, in\r\nformer days, by the good housewives of the adjacent country, from the\r\ninveterate propensity of their husbands to linger about the village\r\ntavern on market days. Be that as it may, I do not vouch for the fact,\r\nbut merely advert to it, for the sake of being precise and authentic.\r\nNot far from this village, perhaps about two miles, there is a little\r\nvalley or rather lap of land among high hills, which is one of the\r\nquietest places in the whole world. A small brook glides through it,\r\nwith just murmur enough to lull one to repose; and the occasional\r\nwhistle of a quail or tapping of a woodpecker is almost the only sound\r\nthat ever breaks in upon the uniform tranquillity.\r\n\r\nI recollect that, when a stripling, my first exploit in\r\nsquirrel-shooting was in a grove of tall walnut-trees that shades one\r\nside of the valley. I had wandered into it at noontime, when all nature\r\nis peculiarly quiet, and was startled by the roar of my own gun, as it\r\nbroke the Sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated\r\nby the angry echoes. If ever I should wish for a retreat whither I might\r\nsteal from the world and its distractions, and dream quietly away the\r\nremnant of a troubled life, I know of none more promising than this\r\nlittle valley.\r\n\r\nFrom the listless repose of the place, and the peculiar character of its\r\ninhabitants, who are descendants from the original Dutch settlers, this\r\nsequestered glen has long been known by the name of SLEEPY HOLLOW, and\r\nits rustic lads are called the Sleepy Hollow Boys throughout all the\r\nneighboring country. A drowsy, dreamy influence seems to hang over the\r\nland, and to pervade the very atmosphere. Some say that the place\r\nwas bewitched by a High German doctor, during the early days of the\r\nsettlement; others, that an old Indian chief, the prophet or wizard of\r\nhis tribe, held his powwows there before the country was discovered by\r\nMaster Hendrick Hudson. Certain it is, the place still continues under\r\nthe sway of some witching power, that holds a spell over the minds of\r\nthe good people, causing them to walk in a continual reverie. They are\r\ngiven to all kinds of marvellous beliefs, are subject to trances and\r\nvisions, and frequently see strange sights, and hear music and voices in\r\nthe air. The whole neighborhood abounds with local tales, haunted spots,\r\nand twilight superstitions; stars shoot and meteors glare oftener across\r\nthe valley than in any other part of the country, and the nightmare,\r\nwith her whole ninefold, seems to make it the favorite scene of her\r\ngambols.\r\n\r\nThe dominant spirit, however, that haunts this enchanted region, and\r\nseems to be commander-in-chief of all the powers of the air, is the\r\napparition of a figure on horseback, without a head. It is said by some\r\nto be the ghost of a Hessian trooper, whose head had been carried away\r\nby a cannon-ball, in some nameless battle during the Revolutionary War,\r\nand who is ever and anon seen by the country folk hurrying along in\r\nthe gloom of night, as if on the wings of the wind. His haunts are not\r\nconfined to the valley, but extend at times to the adjacent roads, and\r\nespecially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance. Indeed,\r\ncertain of the most authentic historians of those parts, who have been\r\ncareful in collecting and collating the floating facts concerning this\r\nspectre, allege that the body of the trooper having been buried in the\r\nchurchyard, the ghost rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly\r\nquest of his head, and that the rushing speed with which he sometimes\r\npasses along the Hollow, like a midnight blast, is owing to his being\r\nbelated, and in a hurry to get back to the churchyard before daybreak.\r\n\r\nSuch is the general purport of this legendary superstition, which has\r\nfurnished materials for many a wild story in that region of shadows; and\r\nthe spectre is known at all the country firesides, by the name of the\r\nHeadless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the visionary propensity I have mentioned is not\r\nconfined to the native inhabitants of the valley, but is unconsciously\r\nimbibed by every one who resides there for a time. However wide awake\r\nthey may have been before they entered that sleepy region, they are\r\nsure, in a little time, to inhale the witching influence of the air, and\r\nbegin to grow imaginative, to dream dreams, and see apparitions.\r\n\r\nI mention this peaceful spot with all possible laud, for it is in such\r\nlittle retired Dutch valleys, found here and there embosomed in the\r\ngreat State of New York, that population, manners, and customs remain\r\nfixed, while the great torrent of migration and improvement, which is\r\nmaking such incessant changes in other parts of this restless country,\r\nsweeps by them unobserved. They are like those little nooks of still\r\nwater, which border a rapid stream, where we may see the straw and\r\nbubble riding quietly at anchor, or slowly revolving in their mimic\r\nharbor, undisturbed by the rush of the passing current. Though many\r\nyears have elapsed since I trod the drowsy shades of Sleepy Hollow, yet\r\nI question whether I should not still find the same trees and the same\r\nfamilies vegetating in its sheltered bosom.\r\n\r\nIn this by-place of nature there abode, in a remote period of American\r\nhistory, that is to say, some thirty years since, a worthy wight of the\r\nname of Ichabod Crane, who sojourned, or, as","extract":"nd Greg Newby\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW\r\n\r\n\r\nby Washington Irving\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUND AMONG THE PAPERS OF THE LATE DIEDRICH KNICKERBOCKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n        A pleasing land of drowsy head it was,\r\n          Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye;\r\n        And of gay castles in the clouds that pass,\r\n          Forever flushing round a summer sky.\r\n                                         CASTLE OF INDOLENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the bosom of one of those spacious coves which indent the eastern\r\nshore of the Hudson, at that broad expansion of the river denominated\r\nby the ancient Dutch navigators the Tappan Zee, and where they always\r\nprudently shortened sail and implored the"},"matches":[],"score":0.4004},{"item":{"author":"Alcott, Louisa May, 1832-1888","title":"Little Women","language":"English","subject":"March family (Fictitious characters) -- Fiction","id":"514","downloads":"4337 downloads in the last 30 days.","book":"LAYING PILGRIMS\r\n          TWO  A MERRY CHRISTMAS\r\n        THREE  THE LAURENCE BOY\r\n         FOUR  BURDENS\r\n         FIVE  BEING NEIGHBORLY\r\n          SIX  BETH FINDS THE PALACE BEAUTIFUL\r\n        SEVEN  AMY'S VALLEY OF HUMILIATION\r\n        EIGHT  JO MEETS APOLLYON\r\n         NINE  MEG GOES TO VANITY FAIR\r\n          TEN  THE P.C.

We can't do much, but we can make our little sacrifices, and\r\nought to do it gladly.  But I am afraid I don't,\" and Meg shook her\r\nhead, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted.\r\n\r\n\"But I don't think the little we should spend would do any good.  We've\r\neach got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped by our giving\r\nthat.  I agree not to expect anything from Mother or you, but I do want\r\nto buy _Undine and Sintran_ for myself.  I've wanted it so long,\" said\r\nJo, who was a bookworm.\r\n\r\n\"I planned to spend mine in new music,\" said Beth, with a little sigh,\r\nwhich no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle-holder.\r\n\r\n\"I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing pencils; I really need\r\nthem,\" said Amy decidedly.\r\n\r\n\"Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't wish us to\r\ngive up everything.  Let's each buy what we want, and have a little\r\nfun; I'm sure we work hard enough to earn it,\" cried Jo, examining the\r\nheels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.\r\n\r\n\"I know I do--teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when I'm\r\nlonging to enjoy myself at home,\" began Meg, in the complaining tone\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"You don't have half such a hard time as I do,\" said Jo. \"How would you\r\nlike to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps\r\nyou trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you're ready to\r\nfly out the window or cry?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and keeping things\r\ntidy is the worst work in the world.  It makes me cross, and my hands\r\nget so stiff, I can't practice well at all.\" And Beth looked at her\r\nrough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe any of you suffer as I do,\" cried Amy, \"for you don't\r\nhave to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you\r\ndon't know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your\r\nfather if he isn't rich, and insult you when your nose isn't nice.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you mean libel, I'd say so, and not talk about labels, as if Papa\r\nwas a pickle bottle,\" advised Jo, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"I know what I mean, and you needn't be statirical about it. It's\r\nproper to use good words, and improve your vocabilary,\" returned Amy,\r\nwith dignity.\r\n\r\n\"Don't peck at one another, children.  Don't you wish we had the money\r\nPapa lost when we were little, Jo?  Dear me! How happy and good we'd\r\nbe, if we had no worries!\" said Meg, who could remember better times.\r\n\r\n\"You said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the\r\nKing children, for they were fighting and fretting all the time, in\r\nspite of their money.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I did, Beth.  Well, I think we are.  For though we do have to work,\r\nwe make fun of ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jo does use such slang words!\" observed Amy, with a reproving look at\r\nthe long figure stretched on the rug.\r\n\r\nJo immediately sat up, put her hands in her pockets, and began to\r\nwhistle.\r\n\r\n\"Don't, Jo.  It's so boyish!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's why I do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I detest rude, unladylike girls!\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!\"\r\n\r\n\"Birds in their little nests agree,\" sang Beth, the peacemaker, with\r\nsuch a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the\r\n\"pecking\" ended for that time.\r\n\r\n\"Really, girls, you are both to be blamed,\" said Meg, beginning to\r\nlecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. \"You are old enough to leave off\r\nboyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine.  It didn't matter so\r\nmuch when you were a little girl, but now you are so tall, and turn up\r\nyour hair, you should remember that you are a young lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not!

The coolie vanished into the shadows of\r\nthe palm trees.\r\n\r\n“What’s the big idea?” The sergeant in command of the anti-aircraft gun\r\nsat up. The air of India was hot and moist that afternoon. He had been\r\nhalf asleep. Now he stared at the cart and its odd contents and then\r\nsent a second questioning look at the girl with the wind-blown hair.\r\n\r\n“You and I are going to do a little practicing.” The girl spoke in a\r\nsteady even tone. Then she smiled.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant looked her up and down. She was, he decided one of those\r\nrare girls who could make even the drab uniform of a WAC look good. She\r\nwas rather large but well proportioned. “An oversize copy of a beautiful\r\ngal,” he told himself.\r\n\r\nTo the girl, after recalling her words, he said:\r\n\r\n“Says who?”\r\n\r\n“Says the Colonel.” Smiling a little more broadly she fished a crumpled\r\nbit of paper from her pocket and handed it to him.\r\n\r\n“Military papers,” he grumbled as he smoothed out the sheet. “Should be\r\nkept in perfect condition, folded neatly.”\r\n\r\n“And read.” She did not smile.\r\n\r\n“Okay—okay, sister. All the same, that’s general orders I’m giving you.\r\nI—”\r\n\r\nHe broke off to stare at the paper. “What’s this?” He glared at the\r\npaper some more. “You are to send small balloons carrying hollow steel\r\nballs up into the sky. Then you are to find them up there in the clouds\r\nand I am to try and shoot them down?”\r\n\r\n“That’s right.”\r\n\r\n“What’s this? A new game for a soldier’s pastime in a strange and\r\nforeign land?” He stared at her afresh.\r\n\r\n“Ever hear of radar?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Sure! They use it in the Navy.”\r\n\r\n“They do. And they’ll use it in the Army too, providing it is possible\r\nto get the co-operation of the Army sergeants in charge of anti-aircraft\r\nguns.”\r\n\r\n“Meaning me? Okay. You win,” he agreed with an unwilling grin. “But\r\nthere’s one line in this paper that is coo-coo. It should say that you\r\nare to try and find those steel balls in the clouds and I’m to shoot ’em\r\ndown.”\r\n\r\n“Wait and see.” She stood her ground.\r\n\r\nThe coolie returned with one end of the electric cord. She connected it\r\nto the box on the cart. Something began to burn. Some tubes lighted up.\r\n\r\n“Now,” she sighed. “It’s hot, don’t you think?”\r\n\r\n“What? That thing? I wouldn’t know,” he said.\r\n\r\n“No. The weather,” she replied.\r\n\r\n“Terrible!” he agreed with conviction. “Just at the end of the rainy\r\nseason! It’s awful having your rest period broken into by a gal in an\r\narmy uniform.” He winked at the two buck privates who helped man his\r\ngun, and they laughed.\r\n\r\nPaying not the least attention to this unflattering bit of drama, the\r\ngirl went about her work. Removing a short steel tube from the cart, she\r\nconnected it with a large paper balloon, then turned on a valve. A\r\nhissing sound followed. The balloon inflated rapidly and pulled at the\r\ncord that held it to the cart. After attaching a metal ball about a foot\r\nin diameter to the balloon, she allowed it to float skyward. It rose\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nSquinting his eyes, the sergeant said: “You expect me to hit t","extract":"\r\n*** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SECRETS OF RADAR ***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProduced by Stephen Hutcheson and the Online Distributed\r\nProofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Secrets of_\r\n                                 RADAR\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BY ROY J.

There were no servants present, and the\r\ngentlemen, with chairs closely approaching, seemed to be discussing some\r\nsubject with great earnestness.\r\n\r\nFor convenience sake, we have said, hitherto, two _gentlemen_. One of\r\nthe parties, however, when critically examined, did not seem, strictly\r\nspeaking, to come under the species. He was a short, thick-set man,\r\nwith coarse, commonplace features, and that swaggering air of pretension\r\nwhich marks a low man who is trying to elbow his way upward in the\r\nworld. He was much over-dressed, in a gaudy vest of many colors, a blue\r\nneckerchief, bedropped gayly with yellow spots, and arranged with a\r\nflaunting tie, quite in keeping with the general air of the man. His\r\nhands, large and coarse, were plentifully bedecked with rings; and he\r\nwore a heavy gold watch-chain, with a bundle of seals of portentous\r\nsize, and a great variety of colors, attached to it,--which, in the\r\nardor of conversation, he was in the habit of flourishing and jingling\r\nwith evident satisfaction. His conversation was in free and easy\r\ndefiance of Murray’s Grammar,* and was garnished at convenient intervals\r\nwith various profane expressions, which not even the desire to be\r\ngraphic in our account shall induce us to transcribe.\r\n\r\n     * English Grammar (1795), by Lindley Murray (1745-1826), the\r\n     most authoritative American grammarian of his day.\r\n\r\nHis companion, Mr. Shelby, had the appearance of a gentleman; and the\r\narrangements of the house, and the general air of the housekeeping,\r\nindicated easy, and even opulent circumstances. As we before stated, the\r\ntwo were in the midst of an earnest conversation.\r\n\r\n“That is the way I should arrange the matter,” said Mr. Shelby.\r\n\r\n“I can’t make trade that way--I positively can’t, Mr. Shelby,” said the\r\nother, holding up a glass of wine between his eye and the light.\r\n\r\n“Why, the fact is, Haley, Tom is an uncommon fellow; he is certainly\r\nworth that sum anywhere,--steady, honest, capable, manages my whole farm\r\nlike a clock.”\r\n\r\n“You mean honest, as niggers go,” said Haley, helping himself to a glass\r\nof brandy.\r\n\r\n“No; I mean, really, Tom is a good, steady, sensible, pious fellow. He\r\ngot religion at a camp-meeting, four years ago; and I believe he\r\nreally _did_ get it. I’ve trusted him, since then, with everything I\r\nhave,--money, house, horses,--and let him come and go round the country;\r\nand I always found him true and square in everything.”\r\n\r\n“Some folks don’t believe there is pious niggers Shelby,” said Haley,\r\nwith a candid flourish of his hand, “but _I do_. I had a fellow, now,\r\nin this yer last lot I took to Orleans--‘t was as good as a meetin, now,\r\nreally, to hear that critter pray; and he was quite gentle and quiet\r\nlike. He fetched me a good sum, too, for I bought him cheap of a man\r\nthat was ’bliged to sell out; so I realized six hundred on him. Yes, I\r\nconsider religion a valeyable thing in a nigger, when it’s the genuine\r\narticle, and no mistake.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Tom’s got the real article, if ever a fellow had,” rejoined the\r\nother. “Why, last fall, I let him go to Cincinnati alone, to do business\r\nfor me, and bring home five hundred dollars. ‘Tom,’ says I to him,\r\n‘I trust you, because I think you’re a Christian--I know you wouldn’t\r\ncheat.’ Tom comes back, sure enough; I knew he would. Some low fellows,\r\nthey say, said to him--Tom, why don’t you make tracks for Canada?’ ’Ah,\r\nmaster trusted me, and I couldn’t,’--they told me about it. I am sorry\r\nto part with Tom, I must say. You ought to let him cover the whole\r\nbalance of the debt; and you would, Haley, if you had any conscience.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ve got just as much conscience as any man in business can\r\nafford to keep,--just a little, you know, to swear by, as ’t were,” said\r\nthe trader, jocularly; “and, then, I’m ready to do anything in reason\r\nto ’blige friends; but this yer, you see, is a leetle too hard on a\r\nfellow--a leetle too hard.” The trader sighed contemplatively, and\r\npoured out some more brandy.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, Haley, how will you trade?” said Mr. Shelby, after an\r\nuneasy interval of silence.\r\n\r\n“Well, haven’t you a boy or gal that you could throw in with Tom?”\r\n\r\n“Hum!--none that I could well spare; to tell the truth, it’s only hard\r\nnecessity makes me willing to sell at all. I don’t like parting with any\r\nof my hands, that’s a fact.”\r\n\r\nHere the door opened, and a small quadroon boy, between four and five\r\nyears of age, entered the room. There was something in his appearance\r\nremarkably beautiful and engaging. His black hair, fine as floss silk,\r\nhung in glossy curls about his round, dimpled face, while a pair of\r\nlarge dark eyes, full of fire and softness, looked out from beneath the\r\nrich, long lashes, as he peered curiously into the apartment. A gay robe\r\nof scarlet and yellow plaid, carefully made and neatly fitted, set off\r\nto advantage the dark and rich style of his beauty; and a certain comic\r\nair of assurance, blended with bashfulness, showed that he had been not\r\nunused to being petted and noticed by his master.\r\n\r\n“Hulloa, Jim Crow!” said Mr. Shelby, whistling, and snapping a bunch of\r\nraisins towards him, “pick that up, now!”\r\n\r\nThe child scampered, with all his little strength, after the prize,\r\nwhile his master laughed.\r\n\r\n“Come here, Jim Crow,” said he. The child came up, and the master patted\r\nthe curly head, and chucked him under the chin.\r\n\r\n“Now, Jim, show this gentleman how you can dance and sing.” The boy\r\ncommenced one of those wild, grotesque songs common among the negroes,\r\nin a rich, clear voice, accompanying his singing with many comic\r\nevolutions of the hands, feet, and whole body, all in perfect time to\r\nthe music.\r\n\r\n“Bravo!” said Haley, throwing him a quarter of an orange.\r\n\r\n“Now, Jim, walk like old Uncle Cudjoe, when he has the rheumatism,” said\r\nhis master.\r\n\r\nInstantly the flexible limbs of the child assumed the appearance of\r\ndeformity and distortion, as, wit","extract":"nd David Widger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNCLE TOM’S CABIN\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nLife among the Lowly\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Harriet Beecher Stowe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME I\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nIn Which the Reader Is Introduced to a Man of Humanity\r\n\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon of a chilly day in February, two gentlemen were\r\nsitting alone over their wine, in a well-furnished dining parlor, in\r\nthe town of P----, in Kentucky.

Dmitri Dmitritch Gurov, who had by then been a fortnight\r\nat Yalta, and so was fairly at home there, had begun to take an interest\r\nin new arrivals. Sitting in Verney's pavilion, he saw, walking on the\r\nsea-front, a fair-haired young lady of medium height, wearing a _béret_;\r\na white Pomeranian dog was running behind her.\r\n\r\nAnd afterwards he met her in the public gardens and in the square\r\nseveral times a day. She was walking alone, always wearing the same\r\n_béret_, and always with the same white dog; no one knew who she was,\r\nand every one called her simply \"the lady with the dog.\"\r\n\r\n\"If she is here alone without a husband or friends, it wouldn't be amiss\r\nto make her acquaintance,\" Gurov reflected.\r\n\r\nHe was under forty, but he had a daughter already twelve years old, and\r\ntwo sons at school. He had been married young, when he was a student in\r\nhis second year, and by now his wife seemed half as old again as he. She\r\nwas a tall, erect woman with dark eyebrows, staid and dignified, and, as\r\nshe said of herself, intellectual. She read a great deal, used phonetic\r\nspelling, called her husband, not Dmitri, but Dimitri, and he secretly\r\nconsidered her unintelligent, narrow, inelegant, was afraid of her, and\r\ndid not like to be at home. He had begun being unfaithful to her long\r\nago--had been unfaithful to her often, and, probably on that account,\r\nalmost always spoke ill of women, and when they were talked about in his\r\npresence, used to call them \"the lower race.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him that he had been so schooled by bitter experience that\r\nhe might call them what he liked, and yet he could not get on for two\r\ndays together without \"the lower race.\" In the society of men he was\r\nbored and not himself, with them he was cold and uncommunicative; but\r\nwhen he was in the company of women he felt free, and knew what to say\r\nto them and how to behave; and he was at ease with them even when he was\r\nsilent. In his appearance, in his character, in his whole nature, there\r\nwas something attractive and elusive which allured women and disposed\r\nthem in his favour; he knew that, and some force seemed to draw him,\r\ntoo, to them.\r\n\r\nExperience often repeated, truly bitter experience, had taught him long\r\nago that with decent people, especially Moscow people--always slow to\r\nmove and irresolute--every intimacy, which at first so agreeably\r\ndiversifies life and appears a light and charming adventure, inevitably\r\ngrows into a regular problem of extreme intricacy, and in the long run\r\nthe situation becomes unbearable. But at every fresh meeting with an\r\ninteresting woman this experience seemed to slip out of his memory, and\r\nhe was eager for life, and everything seemed simple and amusing.\r\n\r\nOne evening he was dining in the gardens, and the lady in the _béret_\r\ncame up slowly to take the next table. Her expression, her gait, her\r\ndress, and the way she did her hair told him that she was a lady, that\r\nshe was married, that she was in Yalta for the first time and alone, and\r\nthat she was dull there.... The stories told of the immorality in such\r\nplaces as Yalta are to a great extent untrue; he despised them, and knew\r\nthat such stories were for the most part made up by persons who would\r\nthemselves have been glad to sin if they had been able; but when the\r\nlady sat down at the next table three paces from him, he remembered\r\nthese tales of easy conquests, of trips to the mountains, and the\r\ntempting thought of a swift, fleeting love affair, a romance with an\r\nunknown woman, whose name he did not know, suddenly took possession of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe beckoned coaxingly to the Pomeranian, and when the dog came up to him\r\nhe shook his finger at it. The Pomeranian growled: Gurov shook his\r\nfinger at it again.\r\n\r\nThe lady looked at him and at once dropped her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"He doesn't bite,\" she said, and blushed.\r\n\r\n\"May I give him a bone?\" he asked; and when she nodded he asked\r\ncourteously, \"Have you been long in Yalta?\"\r\n\r\n\"Five days.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I have already dragged out a fortnight here.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a brief silence.\r\n\r\n\"Time goes fast, and yet it is so dull here!\" she said, not looking at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"That's only the fashion to say it is dull here. A provincial will live\r\nin Belyov or Zhidra and not be dull, and when he comes here it's 'Oh,\r\nthe dulness! Oh, the dust!' One would think he came from Grenada.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed. Then both continued eating in silence, like strangers, but\r\nafter dinner they walked side by side; and there sprang up between them\r\nthe light jesting conversation of people who are free and satisfied, to\r\nwhom it does not matter where they go or what they talk about. They\r\nwalked and talked of the strange light on the sea: the water was of a\r\nsoft warm lilac hue, and there was a golden streak from the moon upon\r\nit. They talked of how sultry it was after a hot day. Gurov told her\r\nthat he came from Moscow, that he had taken his degree in Arts, but had\r\na post in a bank; that he had trained as an opera-singer, but had given\r\nit up, that he owned two houses in Moscow.... And from her he learnt\r\nthat she had grown up in Petersburg, but had lived in S---- since her\r\nmarriage two years before, that she was staying another month in Yalta,\r\nand that her husband, who needed a holiday too, might perhaps come and\r\nfetch her. She was not sure whether her husband had a post in a Crown\r\nDepartment or under the Provincial Council--and was amused by her own\r\nignorance. And Gurov learnt, too, that she was called Anna Sergeyevna.\r\n\r\nAfterwards he thought about her in his room at the hotel--thought she\r\nwould certainly meet him next day; it would be sure to happen. As he got\r\ninto bed he thought how lately she had been a girl at school, doing\r\nlessons like his own daughter; he recalled the diffidence, the\r\nangularity, that was still manifest in her laugh and her manner of\r\ntalking with a stranger. This must have been the first time in her ","extract":"ADY WITH THE DOG AND OTHER STORIES\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nANTON TCHEKHOV\r\n\r\nTranslated by CONSTANCE GARNETT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LADY WITH THE DOG\r\n\r\nA DOCTOR'S VISIT\r\n\r\nAN UPHEAVAL\r\n\r\nIONITCH\r\n\r\nTHE HEAD OF THE FAMILY\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK MONK\r\n\r\nVOLODYA\r\n\r\nAN ANONYMOUS STORY\r\n\r\nTHE HUSBAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LADY WITH THE DOG\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIT was said that a new person had appeared on the sea-front: a lady with\r\na little dog.

I pondered long on the meaning of his instructions when he gave it to me, and kept the manuscript some years, hesitating what to do with it.\r\n\r\nAt length I came to the conclusion knowing his idiosyncracy well, that his fear was only lest any one should know who the writer was; and feeling that it would be sinful to destroy such a history, I copied the manuscript and destroyed the original. He died relationless.\r\n\r\nNo one now can trace the author, no names are mentioned in the book, though they were given freely in the margin of his manuscript, and I alone know to whom the initials refer. If I have done harm in printing it, I have done none to him, have indeed only carried out his evident intention, and given to a few a secret history, which bears the impress of truth on every page, a contribution to psychology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n I began these memoirs when about twenty-five years old, having from youth kept a diary of some sort, which perhaps from habit made me think of recording my inner and secret life.\r\n\r\nWhen I began it, I had scarcely read a baudy book, none of which excepting \"Fanny Hill\" appeared to me to be truthful, that did, and it does so still; the others telling of recherche eroticisms, or of inordinate copulative powers, of the strange twists, tricks, and fancies, of matured voluptuousness, and philosophical lewdness, seemed to my comparative ignorance, as baudy imaginings, or lying inventions, not worthy of belief; although I now know by experience, that they may be true enough, however eccentric, and improbable, they may appear to the uninitiated.\r\n\r\nFanny Hill was a woman's experience. Written perhaps by a woman, where was a man's, written with equal truth? That book has no baudy word in it; but baudy acts need the baudy ejaculations; the erotic, full flavored expressions, which even the chastest indulge in, when lust, or love, is in its full tide of performance. So I determined to write my private life freely as to fact, and in the spirit of the lustful acts done by me, or witnessed; it is written therefore with absolute truth, and without any regard whatever for what the world calls decency. Decency and voluptuousness in its fullest acceptance, cannot exist together, one would kill the other; the poetry of copulation I have only experienced with a few women, which however neither prevented them, nor me from calling a spade, a spade.\r\n\r\nI began it for my amusement; when many years had been chronicled I tired of it and ceased. Some ten years afterwards I met a woman, with whom, or with those she helped me do; I did, said, saw, and heard, well nigh everything a man and woman could do with their genitals, and began to narrate those events, when quite fresh in my memory, a great variety of incidents extending over four years or more. Then I lost sight of her, and my amorous amusements for a while were simpler, but that part of my history was complete.\r\n\r\nAfter a little while, I set to work to describe the events of the intervening years of my youth, and early middle age; which included most of my gallant intrigues and adventures of a frisky order; but not the more lascivious ones of later years. Then an illness caused me to think seriously of burning the whole. But not liking to destroy my labor, I laid it aside again for a couple of years. Then another illness gave me long uninterrupted leisure; I read my manuscript, and filled in some occurrences which I had forgotten, but which my diary enabled me to place in their proper order. This will account for the difference in style in places, which I now observe; and a very needless repetition, of voluptuous descriptions, which I had forgotten, had been before described; that however is inevitable, for human copulation, vary the incidents leading up to it as you may, is, and must be, at all times, much the same affair.\r\n\r\nThen for the first time, I thought I would print my work that had been commenced more than twenty years before, but hesitated. I then had entered my maturity, and on to the most lascivious portion of my life, the events were disjointed, and fragmentary and my amusement was to describe them just after they occurred. Most frequently the next day I wrote all down with much prolixity, since, I have much abbreviated it.\r\n\r\nI had from youth an excellent memory, but about sexual matters a wonderful one. Women were the pleasure of my life. I loved cunt, but also she who had it; I like the woman I fucked and not simply the cunt I fucked, and therein is a great difference. I recollect even now in a degree which astonishes me, the face, color, stature, thighs, backside, and cunt, of well nigh every woman I have had, who was not a mere casual; and even of some who were. The clothes they wore, the houses and rooms in which I had them, were before me mentally, as I wrote, the way the bed, and furniture were placed, the side of the room the windows were on, I remembered perfectly; and all the important events I can fix as to time, sufficiently nearly by reference to my diary, in which the contemporaneous circumstances of my life are recorded.\r\n\r\nI recollect also largely what we said, and did, and generally our baudy amusements. Where I fail to have done so, I have left description blank, rather than attempt to make a story coherent by inserting what was merely probable. I could not now account for my course of action, nor why I did this, or said that, my conduct seems strange, foolish, absurd, very frequently, that of some women, equally so, but I can but state what did occur.\r\n\r\nIn a few cases, I have for what ev","extract":" had been at school and college together, and our intimacy had never been broken.

The Period\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the best of times,\r\nit was the worst of times,\r\nit was the age of wisdom,\r\nit was the age of foolishness,\r\nit was the epoch of belief,\r\nit was the epoch of incredulity,\r\nit was the season of Light,\r\nit was the season of Darkness,\r\nit was the spring of hope,\r\nit was the winter of despair,\r\nwe had everything before us,\r\nwe had nothing before us,\r\nwe were all going direct to Heaven,\r\nwe were all going direct the other way--\r\nin short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of\r\nits noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for\r\nevil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.\r\n\r\nThere were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the\r\nthrone of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with\r\na fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer\r\nthan crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes,\r\nthat things in general were settled for ever.\r\n\r\nIt was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.\r\nSpiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period,\r\nas at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth\r\nblessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had\r\nheralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were\r\nmade for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane\r\nghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its\r\nmessages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally\r\ndeficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the\r\nearthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People,\r\nfrom a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange\r\nto relate, have proved more important to the human race than any\r\ncommunications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane\r\nbrood.\r\n\r\nFrance, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her\r\nsister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down\r\nhill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her\r\nChristian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane\r\nachievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue\r\ntorn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not\r\nkneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks\r\nwhich passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty\r\nyards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and\r\nNorway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death,\r\nalready marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into\r\nboards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in\r\nit, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses\r\nof some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were\r\nsheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with\r\nrustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which\r\nthe Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of\r\nthe Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work\r\nunceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about\r\nwith muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion\r\nthat they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.\r\n\r\nIn England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to\r\njustify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and\r\nhighway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night;\r\nfamilies were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing\r\ntheir furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the highwayman\r\nin the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and\r\nchallenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of\r\n“the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the\r\nmail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and\r\nthen got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the\r\nfailure of his ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace;\r\nthat magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand\r\nand deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the\r\nillustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; p","extract":"udith Boss\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TALE OF TWO CITIES\r\n\r\nA STORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nBy Charles Dickens\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n     Book the First--Recalled to Life\r\n\r\n     Chapter I      The Period\r\n     Chapter II     The Mail\r\n     Chapter III    The Night Shadows\r\n     Chapter IV     The Preparation\r\n     Chapter V      The Wine-shop\r\n     Chapter VI     The Shoemaker\r\n\r\n\r\n     Book the Second--the Golden Thread\r\n\r\n     Chapter I      Five Years Later\r\n     Chapter II     A Sight\r\n     Chapter III    A Disappointment\r\n     Chapter IV     Congratulatory\r\n     Chapter V      The Jackal\r\n     Chapter VI     Hundreds of People\r\n     Chapter VII    Monseigneur in Town\r\n    "},"matches":[{"value":"udith Boss\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TALE OF TWO CITIES\r\n\r\nA STORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nBy Charles Dickens\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n     Book the First--Recalled to Life\r\n\r\n     Chapter I      The Period\r\n     Chapter II     The Mail\r\n     Chapter III    The Night Shadows\r\n     Chapter IV     The Preparation\r\n     Chapter V      The Wine-shop\r\n     Chapter VI     The Shoemaker\r\n\r\n\r\n     Book the Second--the Golden Thread\r\n\r\n     Chapter I      Five Years Later\r\n     Chapter II     A Sight\r\n     Chapter III    A Disappointment\r\n     Chapter IV     Congratulatory\r\n     Chapter V      The Jackal\r\n     Chapter VI     Hundreds of People\r\n     Chapter VII    Monseigneur in Town\r\n    ","key":"extract","arrayIndex":0,"higlights":"udith Boss\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TALE OF TWO CITIES\r\n\r\nA STORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nBy Charles Dickens\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n     Book the First--Recalled to Life\r\n\r\n     Chapter I      The Period\r\n     Chapter II     The Mail\r\n     Chapter III    The Night Shadows\r\n     Chapter IV     The Preparation\r\n     Chapter V      The Wine-shop\r\n     Chapter VI     The Shoemaker\r\n\r\n\r\n     Book the Second--the Golden Thread\r\n\r\n     Chapter I      Five Years Later\r\n     Chapter II     A Sight\r\n     Chapter III    A Disappointment\r\n     Chapter IV     Congratulatory\r\n     Chapter V      The Jackal\r\n     Chapter VI     <em>Hu</em>ndreds of People\r\n     Chapter VII    Monseigneur in Town\r\n    "}],"score":0.4004},{"item":{"author":"Dickens, Charles, 1812-1870","title":"A Christmas Carol in Prose; Being a Ghost Story of Christmas","language":"English","subject":"Scrooge, Ebenezer (Fictitious character) -- Fiction","id":"46","downloads":"7943 downloads in the last 30 days.","book":"PROSE\r\nBEING\r\nA Ghost Story of Christmas\r\n\r\nby Charles Dickens\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nI HAVE endeavoured in this Ghostly little book,\r\nto raise the Ghost of an Idea, which shall not put my\r\nreaders out of humour with themselves, with each other,\r\nwith the season, or with me.

There is no doubt\r\nwhatever about that. The register of his burial was\r\nsigned by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker,\r\nand the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and\r\nScrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for anything he\r\nchose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a\r\ndoor-nail.\r\n\r\nMind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my\r\nown knowledge, what there is particularly dead about\r\na door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to\r\nregard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery\r\nin the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors\r\nis in the simile; and my unhallowed hands\r\nshall not disturb it, or the Country's done for. You\r\nwill therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that\r\nMarley was as dead as a door-nail.\r\n\r\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did.\r\nHow could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were\r\npartners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge\r\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole\r\nassign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and\r\nsole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully\r\ncut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent\r\nman of business on the very day of the funeral,\r\nand solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.\r\n\r\nThe mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to\r\nthe point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley\r\nwas dead. This must be distinctly understood, or\r\nnothing wonderful can come of the story I am going\r\nto relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that\r\nHamlet's Father died before the play began, there\r\nwould be nothing more remarkable in his taking a\r\nstroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\r\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged\r\ngentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy\r\nspot--say Saint Paul's Churchyard for instance--\r\nliterally to astonish his son's weak mind.\r\n\r\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley's name.\r\nThere it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse\r\ndoor: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as\r\nScrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the\r\nbusiness called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley,\r\nbut he answered to both names. It was all the\r\nsame to him.\r\n\r\nOh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone,\r\nScrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping,\r\nclutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint,\r\nfrom which no steel had ever struck out generous fire;\r\nsecret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The\r\ncold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed\r\nnose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his\r\neyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his\r\ngrating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his\r\neyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low\r\ntemperature always about with him; he iced his office in\r\nthe dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.\r\n\r\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on\r\nScrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather\r\nchill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he,\r\nno falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no\r\npelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't\r\nknow where to have him. The heaviest rain, and\r\nsnow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage\r\nover him in only one respect. They often \"came down\"\r\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\r\n\r\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with\r\ngladsome looks, \"My dear Scrooge, how are you?\r\nWhen will you come to see me?\" No beggars implored\r\nhim to bestow a trifle, no children asked him\r\nwhat it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all\r\nhis life inquired the way to such and such a place, of\r\nScrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to\r\nknow him; and when they saw him coming on, would\r\ntug their owners into doorways and up courts; and\r\nthen would wag their tails as though they said, \"No\r\neye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\"\r\n\r\nBut what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing\r\nhe liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths\r\nof life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance,\r\nwas what the knowing ones call \"nuts\" to Scrooge.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year,\r\non Christmas Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his\r\ncounting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy\r\nwithal: and he could hear the people in the court outside,\r\ngo wheezing up and down, beating their hands\r\nupon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the\r\npavement stones to warm them. The city clocks had\r\nonly just gone three, but it was quite dark already--\r\nit had not been light all day--and candles were flaring\r\nin the windows of the neighbouring offices, like\r\nruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog\r\ncame pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was\r\nso dense without, that although the court was of the\r\nnarrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms.\r\nTo see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring\r\neverything, one might have thought that Nature\r\nlived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.\r\n\r\nThe door of Scrooge's counting-house was open\r\nthat he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a\r\ndismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying\r\nletters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's\r\nfire was so very much smaller that it looked like one\r\ncoal. But he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept\r\nthe coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the\r\nclerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted\r\nthat it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore\r\nthe clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to\r\nwarm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being\r\na man of a strong imagination, he failed.\r\n\r\n\"A merry C","extract":"PROSE\r\nBEING\r\nA Ghost Story of Christmas\r\n\r\nby Charles Dickens\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nI HAVE endeavoured in this Ghostly little book,\r\nto raise the Ghost of an Idea, which shall not put my\r\nreaders out of humour with themselves, with each other,\r\nwith the season, or with me.

Marseilles—The Arrival\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde\r\nsignalled the three-master, the Pharaon from Smyrna, Trieste, and\r\nNaples.\r\n\r\nAs usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Château d’If,\r\ngot on board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island.\r\n\r\nImmediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean\r\nwere covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a\r\nship to come into port, especially when this ship, like the Pharaon, has\r\nbeen built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs to an\r\nowner of the city.\r\n\r\nThe ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic\r\nshock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled\r\nPomègue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker, but\r\nso slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is the\r\nforerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have\r\nhappened on board. However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly\r\nthat if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself, for\r\nshe bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the\r\nanchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by\r\nthe side of the pilot, who was steering the Pharaon towards the narrow\r\nentrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity and\r\nvigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each\r\ndirection of the pilot.\r\n\r\nThe vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much\r\naffected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the\r\nvessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled\r\nalongside the Pharaon, which he reached as she rounded into La Réserve\r\nbasin.\r\n\r\nWhen the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his\r\nstation by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship’s bulwarks.\r\n\r\nHe was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with black\r\neyes, and hair as dark as a raven’s wing; and his whole appearance\r\nbespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from\r\ntheir cradle to contend with danger.\r\n\r\n“Ah, is it you, Dantès?” cried the man in the skiff. “What’s the matt","extract":", and\r\nDavid Widger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO\r\n\r\n\r\nby Alexandre Dumas [père]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n0009m\r\n\r\n\r\n0011m\r\n\r\n\r\n0019m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContents\r\n\r\nVOLUME ONE\r\n\r\nChapter 1.

Allez vous-en! Sapristi! That's all right!”\r\n\r\nHe could speak a little Spanish, and also a language which nobody\r\nunderstood, unless it was the mocking-bird that hung on the other\r\nside of the door, whistling his fluty notes out upon the breeze with\r\nmaddening persistence.\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier, unable to read his newspaper with any degree of comfort,\r\narose with an expression and an exclamation of disgust.\r\n\r\nHe walked down the gallery and across the narrow “bridges” which\r\nconnected the Lebrun cottages one with the other. He had been seated\r\nbefore the door of the main house. The parrot and the mockingbird were\r\nthe property of Madame Lebrun, and they had the right to make all the\r\nnoise they wished. Mr. Pontellier had the privilege of quitting their\r\nsociety when they ceased to be entertaining.\r\n\r\nHe stopped before the door of his own cottage, which was the fourth one\r\nfrom the main building and next to the last. Seating himself in a wicker\r\nrocker which was there, he once more applied himself to the task of\r\nreading the newspaper. The day was Sunday; the paper was a day old. The\r\nSunday papers had not yet reached Grand Isle. He was already acquainted\r\nwith the market reports, and he glanced restlessly over the editorials\r\nand bits of news which he had not had time to read before quitting New\r\nOrleans the day before.\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier wore eye-glasses. He was a man of forty, of medium height\r\nand rather slender build; he stooped a little. His hair was brown and\r\nstraight, parted on one side. His beard was neatly and closely trimmed.\r\n\r\nOnce in a while he withdrew his glance from the newspaper and looked\r\nabout him. There was more noise than ever over at the house. The main\r\nbuilding was called “the house,” to distinguish it from the cottages.\r\nThe chattering and whistling birds were still at it. Two young girls,\r\nthe Farival twins, were playing a duet from “Zampa” upon the piano.\r\nMadame Lebrun was bustling in and out, giving orders in a high key to a\r\nyard-boy whenever she got inside the house, and directions in an equally\r\nhigh voice to a dining-room servant whenever she got outside. She was\r\na fresh, pretty woman, clad always in white with elbow sleeves. Her\r\nstarched skirts crinkled as she came and went. Farther down, before\r\none of the cottages, a lady in black was walking demurely up and down,\r\ntelling her beads. A good many persons of the pension had gone over to\r\nthe Cheniere Caminada in Beaudelet's lugger to hear mass. Some young\r\npeople were out under the wateroaks playing croquet. Mr. Pontellier's\r\ntwo children were there--sturdy little fellows of four and five. A\r\nquadroon nurse followed them about with a faraway, meditative air.\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier finally lit a cigar and began to smoke, letting the paper\r\ndrag idly from his hand. He fixed his gaze upon a white sunshade that\r\nwas advancing at snail's pace from the beach. He could see it plainly\r\nbetween the gaunt trunks of the water-oaks and across the stretch of\r\nyellow camomile. The gulf looked far away, melting hazily into the blue\r\nof the horizon. The sunshade continued to approach slowly. Beneath its\r\npink-lined shelter were his wife, Mrs. Pontellier, and young Robert\r\nLebrun. When they reached the cottage, the two seated themselves with\r\nsome appearance of fatigue upon the upper step of the porch, facing each\r\nother, each leaning against a supporting post.\r\n\r\n“What folly! to bathe at such an hour in such heat!” exclaimed Mr.\r\nPontellier. He himself had taken a plunge at daylight. That was why the\r\nmorning seemed long to him.\r\n\r\n“You are burnt beyond recognition,” he added, looking at his wife as one\r\nlooks at a valuable piece of personal property which has suffered some\r\ndamage. She held up her hands, strong, shapely hands, and surveyed them\r\ncritically, drawing up her fawn sleeves above the wrists. Looking at\r\nthem reminded her of her rings, which she had given to her husband\r\nbefore leaving for the beach. She silently reached out to him, and he,\r\nunderstanding, took the rings from his vest pocket and dropped them\r\ninto her open palm. She slipped them upon her fingers; then clasping\r\nher knees, she looked across at Robert and began to laugh. The rings\r\nsparkled upon her fingers. He sent back an answering smile.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked Pontellier, looking lazily and amused from one to\r\nthe other. It was some utter nonsense; some adventure out there in the\r\nwater, and they both tried to relate it at once. It did not seem half\r\nso amusing when told. They realized this, and so did Mr. Pontellier. He\r\nyawned and stretched himself. Then he got up, saying he had half a mind\r\nto go over to Klein's hotel and play a game of billiards.\r\n\r\n“Come go along, Lebrun,” he proposed to Robert. But Robert admitted\r\nquite frankly that he preferred to stay where he was and talk to Mrs.\r\nPontellier.\r\n\r\n“Well, send him about his business when he bores you, Edna,” instructed\r\nher husband as he prepared to leave.\r\n\r\n“Here, take the umbrella,” she exclaimed, holding it out to him. He\r\naccepted the sunshade, and lifting it over his head descended the steps\r\nand walked away.\r\n\r\n“Coming back to dinner?” his wife called after him. He halted a moment\r\nand shrugged his shoulders. He felt in his vest pocket; there was a\r\nten-dollar bill there. He did not know; perhaps he would return for the\r\nearly dinner and perhaps he would not. It all depended upon the company\r\nwhich he found over at Klein's and the size of “the game.” He did not\r\nsay this, but she understood it, and laughed, nodding good-by to him.\r\n\r\nBoth children wanted to follow their father when they saw him starting\r\nout. He kissed them and promised to bring them back bonbons and peanuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Pontellier's eyes were quick and bright; they were a yellowish\r\nbrown, about the color of her hair.

JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE ***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE\r\n\r\nby Robert Louis Stevenson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORY OF THE DOOR\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was never\r\nlighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse; backward\r\nin sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow lovable.\r\nAt friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste, something\r\neminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which never\r\nfound its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these silent\r\nsymbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in the acts\r\nof his life. He was austere with himself; drank gin when he was alone,\r\nto mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the theatre, had\r\nnot crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he had an approved\r\ntolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with envy, at the high\r\npressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and in any extremity\r\ninclined to help rather than to reprove. “I incline to Cain’s heresy,”\r\n he used to say quaintly: “I let my brother go to the devil in his own\r\nway.” In this character, it was frequently his fortune to be the last\r\nreputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives of\r\ndowngoing men. And to such as these, so long as they came about his\r\nchambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative\r\nat the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar\r\ncatholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to accept his\r\nfriendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that was\r\nthe lawyer’s way. His friends were those of his own blood or those whom\r\nhe had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the growth of\r\ntime, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt the\r\nbond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman, the\r\nwell-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for many, what these\r\ntwo could see in each other, or what subject they could find in common.\r\nIt was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday walks,\r\nthat they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail with\r\nobvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two men put\r\nthe greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief jewel\r\nof each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but\r\neven resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them\r\nuninterrupted.\r\n\r\nIt chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a\r\nby-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what\r\nis called quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The\r\ninhabitants were all doing well, it seemed and all emulously hoping to\r\ndo better still, and laying out the surplus of their grains in coquetry;\r\nso that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of\r\ninvitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday, when it\r\nveiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage,\r\nthe street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a\r\nfire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters, well-polished\r\nbrasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught\r\nand pleased the eye of the passenger.\r\n\r\nTwo doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was\r\nbroken by the entry of a court; and just at that point a certain\r\nsinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street. It\r\nwas two storeys high; showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower\r\nstorey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper; and bore\r\nin every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence. The\r\ndoor, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered\r\nand distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on the\r\npanels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had tried\r\nhis knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one had\r\nappeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their ravages.\r\n\r\nMr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; but\r\nwhen they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane and\r\npointed.\r\n\r\n“Did you ever remark that door?” he asked; and when his companion had\r\nreplied in the affirmative. “It is connected in my mind,” added he,\r\n“with a very odd story.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” said Mr. Utterson, with a slight change of voice, “and what\r\nwas that?”\r\n\r\n“Well, it was this way,” returned Mr. Enfield: “I was coming home from\r\nsome place at the end of the world, about three o’clock of a black\r\nwinter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was\r\nliterally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street and all the\r\nfolks asleep--street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession\r\nand all as empty as a church--till at last I got into that state of mind\r\nwhen a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a\r\npoliceman. All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was\r\nstumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe\r\neight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross\r\nstreet. Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at\r\nthe corner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man\r\ntrampled calmly over the child’s body and left her screaming on the\r\nground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It wasn’t\r\nlike a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a few halloa,\r\ntook to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where\r\nthere was already quite a group about the screaming child. He was\r\nperfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly\r\nthat it brought out the sweat on me like running. The people who had\r\nturned out were the girl’s own family; and pretty soon, the doctor, for\r\nwhom she had been sent put in his appearance. Well, the child was not\r\nmuch the worse, more frightened, according to the Sawbones; and there\r\nyou might have supposed would be an end to it. But there was one curious\r\ncircumstance.

The winged fairies of Grimm and Andersen have brought more\r\nhappiness to childish hearts than all other human creations.\r\n\r\nYet the old time fairy tale, having served for generations, may now be\r\nclassed as \"historical\" in the children's library; for the time has\r\ncome for a series of newer \"wonder tales\" in which the stereotyped\r\ngenie, dwarf and fairy are eliminated, together with all the horrible\r\nand blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a\r\nfearsome moral to each tale.  Modern education includes morality;\r\ntherefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales\r\nand gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident.\r\n\r\nHaving this thought in mind, the story of \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\"\r\nwas written solely to please children of today.  It aspires to being a\r\nmodernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and\r\nthe heartaches and nightmares are left out.\r\n\r\n\r\nL. Frank Baum\r\n\r\nChicago, April, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  The Cyclone\r\n\r\n\r\nDorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle\r\nHenry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife.  Their\r\nhouse was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon\r\nmany miles.  There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one\r\nroom; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for\r\nthe dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds.  Uncle Henry\r\nand Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in\r\nanother corner.  There was no garret at all, and no cellar--except a\r\nsmall hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family\r\ncould go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to\r\ncrush any building in its path.  It was reached by a trap door in the\r\nmiddle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark\r\nhole.\r\n\r\nWhen Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see\r\nnothing but the great gray prairie on every side.  Not a tree nor a\r\nhouse broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of\r\nthe sky in all directions.  The sun had baked the plowed land into a\r\ngray mass, with little cracks running through it.  Even the grass was\r\nnot green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until\r\nthey were the same gray color to be seen everywhere.  Once the house\r\nhad been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed\r\nit away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.\r\n\r\nWhen Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife.  The sun\r\nand wind had changed her, too.  They had taken the sparkle from her\r\neyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks\r\nand lips, and they were gray also.  She was thin and gaunt, and never\r\nsmiled now.  When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt\r\nEm had been so startled by the child's laughter that she would scream\r\nand press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy's merry voice\r\nreached her ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder\r\nthat she could find anything to laugh at.\r\n\r\nUncle Henry never laughed.  He worked hard from morning till night and\r\ndid not know what joy was.  He was gray also, from his long beard to\r\nhis rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.\r\n\r\nIt was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray\r\nas her other surroundings.  Toto was not gray; he was a little black\r\ndog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on\r\neither side of his funny, wee nose.  Toto played all day long, and\r\nDorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.\r\n\r\nToday, however, they were not playing.  Uncle Henry sat upon the\r\ndoorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than\r\nusual.  Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at\r\nthe sky too.  Aunt Em was washing the dishes.\r\n\r\nFrom the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry\r\nand Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the\r\ncoming storm.  There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the\r\nsouth, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the\r\ngrass coming from that direction also.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Uncle Henry stood up.\r\n\r\n\"There's a cyclone coming, Em,\" he called to his wife.  \"I'll go look\r\nafter the stock.\"  Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and\r\nhorses were kept.\r\n\r\nAunt Em dropped her work and came to the door.  One glance told her of\r\nthe danger close at hand.\r\n\r\n\"Quick, Dorothy!\" she screamed.  \"Run for the cellar!\"\r\n\r\nToto jumped out of Dorothy's arms and hid under the bed, and the girl\r\nstarted to get him.  Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the trap\r\ndoor in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark\r\nhole.  Dorothy caught Toto at last and started to follow her aunt.\r\nWhen she was halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the\r\nwind, and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat\r\ndown suddenly upon the floor.\r\n\r\nThen a strange thing happened.\r\n\r\nThe house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the\r\nair.  Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.\r\n\r\nThe north and south winds met where th","extract":"\n   2.  The Council with the Munchkins\r\n   3.

This name was given, we are told, in\r\nformer days, by the good housewives of the adjacent country, from the\r\ninveterate propensity of their husbands to linger about the village\r\ntavern on market days. Be that as it may, I do not vouch for the fact,\r\nbut merely advert to it, for the sake of being precise and authentic.\r\nNot far from this village, perhaps about two miles, there is a little\r\nvalley or rather lap of land among high hills, which is one of the\r\nquietest places in the whole world. A small brook glides through it,\r\nwith just murmur enough to lull one to repose; and the occasional\r\nwhistle of a quail or tapping of a woodpecker is almost the only sound\r\nthat ever breaks in upon the uniform tranquillity.\r\n\r\nI recollect that, when a stripling, my first exploit in\r\nsquirrel-shooting was in a grove of tall walnut-trees that shades one\r\nside of the valley. I had wandered into it at noontime, when all nature\r\nis peculiarly quiet, and was startled by the roar of my own gun, as it\r\nbroke the Sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated\r\nby the angry echoes. If ever I should wish for a retreat whither I might\r\nsteal from the world and its distractions, and dream quietly away the\r\nremnant of a troubled life, I know of none more promising than this\r\nlittle valley.\r\n\r\nFrom the listless repose of the place, and the peculiar character of its\r\ninhabitants, who are descendants from the original Dutch settlers, this\r\nsequestered glen has long been known by the name of SLEEPY HOLLOW, and\r\nits rustic lads are called the Sleepy Hollow Boys throughout all the\r\nneighboring country. A drowsy, dreamy influence seems to hang over the\r\nland, and to pervade the very atmosphere. Some say that the place\r\nwas bewitched by a High German doctor, during the early days of the\r\nsettlement; others, that an old Indian chief, the prophet or wizard of\r\nhis tribe, held his powwows there before the country was discovered by\r\nMaster Hendrick Hudson. Certain it is, the place still continues under\r\nthe sway of some witching power, that holds a spell over the minds of\r\nthe good people, causing them to walk in a continual reverie. They are\r\ngiven to all kinds of marvellous beliefs, are subject to trances and\r\nvisions, and frequently see strange sights, and hear music and voices in\r\nthe air. The whole neighborhood abounds with local tales, haunted spots,\r\nand twilight superstitions; stars shoot and meteors glare oftener across\r\nthe valley than in any other part of the country, and the nightmare,\r\nwith her whole ninefold, seems to make it the favorite scene of her\r\ngambols.\r\n\r\nThe dominant spirit, however, that haunts this enchanted region, and\r\nseems to be commander-in-chief of all the powers of the air, is the\r\napparition of a figure on horseback, without a head. It is said by some\r\nto be the ghost of a Hessian trooper, whose head had been carried away\r\nby a cannon-ball, in some nameless battle during the Revolutionary War,\r\nand who is ever and anon seen by the country folk hurrying along in\r\nthe gloom of night, as if on the wings of the wind. His haunts are not\r\nconfined to the valley, but extend at times to the adjacent roads, and\r\nespecially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance. Indeed,\r\ncertain of the most authentic historians of those parts, who have been\r\ncareful in collecting and collating the floating facts concerning this\r\nspectre, allege that the body of the trooper having been buried in the\r\nchurchyard, the ghost rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly\r\nquest of his head, and that the rushing speed with which he sometimes\r\npasses along the Hollow, like a midnight blast, is owing to his being\r\nbelated, and in a hurry to get back to the churchyard before daybreak.\r\n\r\nSuch is the general purport of this legendary superstition, which has\r\nfurnished materials for many a wild story in that region of shadows; and\r\nthe spectre is known at all the country firesides, by the name of the\r\nHeadless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the visionary propensity I have mentioned is not\r\nconfined to the native inhabitants of the valley, but is unconsciously\r\nimbibed by every one who resides there for a time. However wide awake\r\nthey may have been before they entered that sleepy region, they are\r\nsure, in a little time, to inhale the witching influence of the air, and\r\nbegin to grow imaginative, to dream dreams, and see apparitions.\r\n\r\nI mention this peaceful spot with all possible laud, for it is in such\r\nlittle retired Dutch valleys, found here and there embosomed in the\r\ngreat State of New York, that population, manners, and customs remain\r\nfixed, while the great torrent of migration and improvement, which is\r\nmaking such incessant changes in other parts of this restless country,\r\nsweeps by them unobserved. They are like those little nooks of still\r\nwater, which border a rapid stream, where we may see the straw and\r\nbubble riding quietly at anchor, or slowly revolving in their mimic\r\nharbor, undisturbed by the rush of the passing current. Though many\r\nyears have elapsed since I trod the drowsy shades of Sleepy Hollow, yet\r\nI question whether I should not still find the same trees and the same\r\nfamilies vegetating in its sheltered bosom.\r\n\r\nIn this by-place of nature there abode, in a remote period of American\r\nhistory, that is to say, some thirty years since, a worthy wight of the\r\nname of Ichabod Crane, who sojourned, or, as","extract":"nd Greg Newby\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW\r\n\r\n\r\nby Washington Irving\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUND AMONG THE PAPERS OF THE LATE DIEDRICH KNICKERBOCKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n        A pleasing land of drowsy head it was,\r\n          Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye;\r\n        And of gay castles in the clouds that pass,\r\n          Forever flushing round a summer sky.\r\n                                         CASTLE OF INDOLENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the bosom of one of those spacious coves which indent the eastern\r\nshore of the Hudson, at that broad expansion of the river denominated\r\nby the ancient Dutch navigators the Tappan Zee, and where they always\r\nprudently shortened sail and implored the"},"matches":[],"score":0.4004},{"item":{"author":"Alcott, Louisa May, 1832-1888","title":"Little Women","language":"English","subject":"March family (Fictitious characters) -- Fiction","id":"514","downloads":"4337 downloads in the last 30 days.","book":"LAYING PILGRIMS\r\n          TWO  A MERRY CHRISTMAS\r\n        THREE  THE LAURENCE BOY\r\n         FOUR  BURDENS\r\n         FIVE  BEING NEIGHBORLY\r\n          SIX  BETH FINDS THE PALACE BEAUTIFUL\r\n        SEVEN  AMY'S VALLEY OF HUMILIATION\r\n        EIGHT  JO MEETS APOLLYON\r\n         NINE  MEG GOES TO VANITY FAIR\r\n          TEN  THE P.C.

We can't do much, but we can make our little sacrifices, and\r\nought to do it gladly.  But I am afraid I don't,\" and Meg shook her\r\nhead, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted.\r\n\r\n\"But I don't think the little we should spend would do any good.  We've\r\neach got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped by our giving\r\nthat.  I agree not to expect anything from Mother or you, but I do want\r\nto buy _Undine and Sintran_ for myself.  I've wanted it so long,\" said\r\nJo, who was a bookworm.\r\n\r\n\"I planned to spend mine in new music,\" said Beth, with a little sigh,\r\nwhich no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle-holder.\r\n\r\n\"I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing pencils; I really need\r\nthem,\" said Amy decidedly.\r\n\r\n\"Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't wish us to\r\ngive up everything.  Let's each buy what we want, and have a little\r\nfun; I'm sure we work hard enough to earn it,\" cried Jo, examining the\r\nheels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.\r\n\r\n\"I know I do--teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when I'm\r\nlonging to enjoy myself at home,\" began Meg, in the complaining tone\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"You don't have half such a hard time as I do,\" said Jo. \"How would you\r\nlike to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps\r\nyou trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you're ready to\r\nfly out the window or cry?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and keeping things\r\ntidy is the worst work in the world.  It makes me cross, and my hands\r\nget so stiff, I can't practice well at all.\" And Beth looked at her\r\nrough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe any of you suffer as I do,\" cried Amy, \"for you don't\r\nhave to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you\r\ndon't know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your\r\nfather if he isn't rich, and insult you when your nose isn't nice.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you mean libel, I'd say so, and not talk about labels, as if Papa\r\nwas a pickle bottle,\" advised Jo, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"I know what I mean, and you needn't be statirical about it. It's\r\nproper to use good words, and improve your vocabilary,\" returned Amy,\r\nwith dignity.\r\n\r\n\"Don't peck at one another, children.  Don't you wish we had the money\r\nPapa lost when we were little, Jo?  Dear me! How happy and good we'd\r\nbe, if we had no worries!\" said Meg, who could remember better times.\r\n\r\n\"You said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the\r\nKing children, for they were fighting and fretting all the time, in\r\nspite of their money.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I did, Beth.  Well, I think we are.  For though we do have to work,\r\nwe make fun of ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jo does use such slang words!\" observed Amy, with a reproving look at\r\nthe long figure stretched on the rug.\r\n\r\nJo immediately sat up, put her hands in her pockets, and began to\r\nwhistle.\r\n\r\n\"Don't, Jo.  It's so boyish!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's why I do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I detest rude, unladylike girls!\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!\"\r\n\r\n\"Birds in their little nests agree,\" sang Beth, the peacemaker, with\r\nsuch a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the\r\n\"pecking\" ended for that time.\r\n\r\n\"Really, girls, you are both to be blamed,\" said Meg, beginning to\r\nlecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. \"You are old enough to leave off\r\nboyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine.  It didn't matter so\r\nmuch when you were a little girl, but now you are so tall, and turn up\r\nyour hair, you should remember that you are a young lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not!

The coolie vanished into the shadows of\r\nthe palm trees.\r\n\r\n“What’s the big idea?” The sergeant in command of the anti-aircraft gun\r\nsat up. The air of India was hot and moist that afternoon. He had been\r\nhalf asleep. Now he stared at the cart and its odd contents and then\r\nsent a second questioning look at the girl with the wind-blown hair.\r\n\r\n“You and I are going to do a little practicing.” The girl spoke in a\r\nsteady even tone. Then she smiled.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant looked her up and down. She was, he decided one of those\r\nrare girls who could make even the drab uniform of a WAC look good. She\r\nwas rather large but well proportioned. “An oversize copy of a beautiful\r\ngal,” he told himself.\r\n\r\nTo the girl, after recalling her words, he said:\r\n\r\n“Says who?”\r\n\r\n“Says the Colonel.” Smiling a little more broadly she fished a crumpled\r\nbit of paper from her pocket and handed it to him.\r\n\r\n“Military papers,” he grumbled as he smoothed out the sheet. “Should be\r\nkept in perfect condition, folded neatly.”\r\n\r\n“And read.” She did not smile.\r\n\r\n“Okay—okay, sister. All the same, that’s general orders I’m giving you.\r\nI—”\r\n\r\nHe broke off to stare at the paper. “What’s this?” He glared at the\r\npaper some more. “You are to send small balloons carrying hollow steel\r\nballs up into the sky. Then you are to find them up there in the clouds\r\nand I am to try and shoot them down?”\r\n\r\n“That’s right.”\r\n\r\n“What’s this? A new game for a soldier’s pastime in a strange and\r\nforeign land?” He stared at her afresh.\r\n\r\n“Ever hear of radar?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Sure! They use it in the Navy.”\r\n\r\n“They do. And they’ll use it in the Army too, providing it is possible\r\nto get the co-operation of the Army sergeants in charge of anti-aircraft\r\nguns.”\r\n\r\n“Meaning me? Okay. You win,” he agreed with an unwilling grin. “But\r\nthere’s one line in this paper that is coo-coo. It should say that you\r\nare to try and find those steel balls in the clouds and I’m to shoot ’em\r\ndown.”\r\n\r\n“Wait and see.” She stood her ground.\r\n\r\nThe coolie returned with one end of the electric cord. She connected it\r\nto the box on the cart. Something began to burn. Some tubes lighted up.\r\n\r\n“Now,” she sighed. “It’s hot, don’t you think?”\r\n\r\n“What? That thing? I wouldn’t know,” he said.\r\n\r\n“No. The weather,” she replied.\r\n\r\n“Terrible!” he agreed with conviction. “Just at the end of the rainy\r\nseason! It’s awful having your rest period broken into by a gal in an\r\narmy uniform.” He winked at the two buck privates who helped man his\r\ngun, and they laughed.\r\n\r\nPaying not the least attention to this unflattering bit of drama, the\r\ngirl went about her work. Removing a short steel tube from the cart, she\r\nconnected it with a large paper balloon, then turned on a valve. A\r\nhissing sound followed. The balloon inflated rapidly and pulled at the\r\ncord that held it to the cart. After attaching a metal ball about a foot\r\nin diameter to the balloon, she allowed it to float skyward. It rose\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nSquinting his eyes, the sergeant said: “You expect me to hit t","extract":"\r\n*** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SECRETS OF RADAR ***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProduced by Stephen Hutcheson and the Online Distributed\r\nProofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Secrets of_\r\n                                 RADAR\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BY ROY J.

There were no servants present, and the\r\ngentlemen, with chairs closely approaching, seemed to be discussing some\r\nsubject with great earnestness.\r\n\r\nFor convenience sake, we have said, hitherto, two _gentlemen_. One of\r\nthe parties, however, when critically examined, did not seem, strictly\r\nspeaking, to come under the species. He was a short, thick-set man,\r\nwith coarse, commonplace features, and that swaggering air of pretension\r\nwhich marks a low man who is trying to elbow his way upward in the\r\nworld. He was much over-dressed, in a gaudy vest of many colors, a blue\r\nneckerchief, bedropped gayly with yellow spots, and arranged with a\r\nflaunting tie, quite in keeping with the general air of the man. His\r\nhands, large and coarse, were plentifully bedecked with rings; and he\r\nwore a heavy gold watch-chain, with a bundle of seals of portentous\r\nsize, and a great variety of colors, attached to it,--which, in the\r\nardor of conversation, he was in the habit of flourishing and jingling\r\nwith evident satisfaction. His conversation was in free and easy\r\ndefiance of Murray’s Grammar,* and was garnished at convenient intervals\r\nwith various profane expressions, which not even the desire to be\r\ngraphic in our account shall induce us to transcribe.\r\n\r\n     * English Grammar (1795), by Lindley Murray (1745-1826), the\r\n     most authoritative American grammarian of his day.\r\n\r\nHis companion, Mr. Shelby, had the appearance of a gentleman; and the\r\narrangements of the house, and the general air of the housekeeping,\r\nindicated easy, and even opulent circumstances. As we before stated, the\r\ntwo were in the midst of an earnest conversation.\r\n\r\n“That is the way I should arrange the matter,” said Mr. Shelby.\r\n\r\n“I can’t make trade that way--I positively can’t, Mr. Shelby,” said the\r\nother, holding up a glass of wine between his eye and the light.\r\n\r\n“Why, the fact is, Haley, Tom is an uncommon fellow; he is certainly\r\nworth that sum anywhere,--steady, honest, capable, manages my whole farm\r\nlike a clock.”\r\n\r\n“You mean honest, as niggers go,” said Haley, helping himself to a glass\r\nof brandy.\r\n\r\n“No; I mean, really, Tom is a good, steady, sensible, pious fellow. He\r\ngot religion at a camp-meeting, four years ago; and I believe he\r\nreally _did_ get it. I’ve trusted him, since then, with everything I\r\nhave,--money, house, horses,--and let him come and go round the country;\r\nand I always found him true and square in everything.”\r\n\r\n“Some folks don’t believe there is pious niggers Shelby,” said Haley,\r\nwith a candid flourish of his hand, “but _I do_. I had a fellow, now,\r\nin this yer last lot I took to Orleans--‘t was as good as a meetin, now,\r\nreally, to hear that critter pray; and he was quite gentle and quiet\r\nlike. He fetched me a good sum, too, for I bought him cheap of a man\r\nthat was ’bliged to sell out; so I realized six hundred on him. Yes, I\r\nconsider religion a valeyable thing in a nigger, when it’s the genuine\r\narticle, and no mistake.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Tom’s got the real article, if ever a fellow had,” rejoined the\r\nother. “Why, last fall, I let him go to Cincinnati alone, to do business\r\nfor me, and bring home five hundred dollars. ‘Tom,’ says I to him,\r\n‘I trust you, because I think you’re a Christian--I know you wouldn’t\r\ncheat.’ Tom comes back, sure enough; I knew he would. Some low fellows,\r\nthey say, said to him--Tom, why don’t you make tracks for Canada?’ ’Ah,\r\nmaster trusted me, and I couldn’t,’--they told me about it. I am sorry\r\nto part with Tom, I must say. You ought to let him cover the whole\r\nbalance of the debt; and you would, Haley, if you had any conscience.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ve got just as much conscience as any man in business can\r\nafford to keep,--just a little, you know, to swear by, as ’t were,” said\r\nthe trader, jocularly; “and, then, I’m ready to do anything in reason\r\nto ’blige friends; but this yer, you see, is a leetle too hard on a\r\nfellow--a leetle too hard.” The trader sighed contemplatively, and\r\npoured out some more brandy.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, Haley, how will you trade?” said Mr. Shelby, after an\r\nuneasy interval of silence.\r\n\r\n“Well, haven’t you a boy or gal that you could throw in with Tom?”\r\n\r\n“Hum!--none that I could well spare; to tell the truth, it’s only hard\r\nnecessity makes me willing to sell at all. I don’t like parting with any\r\nof my hands, that’s a fact.”\r\n\r\nHere the door opened, and a small quadroon boy, between four and five\r\nyears of age, entered the room. There was something in his appearance\r\nremarkably beautiful and engaging. His black hair, fine as floss silk,\r\nhung in glossy curls about his round, dimpled face, while a pair of\r\nlarge dark eyes, full of fire and softness, looked out from beneath the\r\nrich, long lashes, as he peered curiously into the apartment. A gay robe\r\nof scarlet and yellow plaid, carefully made and neatly fitted, set off\r\nto advantage the dark and rich style of his beauty; and a certain comic\r\nair of assurance, blended with bashfulness, showed that he had been not\r\nunused to being petted and noticed by his master.\r\n\r\n“Hulloa, Jim Crow!” said Mr. Shelby, whistling, and snapping a bunch of\r\nraisins towards him, “pick that up, now!”\r\n\r\nThe child scampered, with all his little strength, after the prize,\r\nwhile his master laughed.\r\n\r\n“Come here, Jim Crow,” said he. The child came up, and the master patted\r\nthe curly head, and chucked him under the chin.\r\n\r\n“Now, Jim, show this gentleman how you can dance and sing.” The boy\r\ncommenced one of those wild, grotesque songs common among the negroes,\r\nin a rich, clear voice, accompanying his singing with many comic\r\nevolutions of the hands, feet, and whole body, all in perfect time to\r\nthe music.\r\n\r\n“Bravo!” said Haley, throwing him a quarter of an orange.\r\n\r\n“Now, Jim, walk like old Uncle Cudjoe, when he has the rheumatism,” said\r\nhis master.\r\n\r\nInstantly the flexible limbs of the child assumed the appearance of\r\ndeformity and distortion, as, wit","extract":"nd David Widger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNCLE TOM’S CABIN\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nLife among the Lowly\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Harriet Beecher Stowe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME I\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nIn Which the Reader Is Introduced to a Man of Humanity\r\n\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon of a chilly day in February, two gentlemen were\r\nsitting alone over their wine, in a well-furnished dining parlor, in\r\nthe town of P----, in Kentucky.

Dmitri Dmitritch Gurov, who had by then been a fortnight\r\nat Yalta, and so was fairly at home there, had begun to take an interest\r\nin new arrivals. Sitting in Verney's pavilion, he saw, walking on the\r\nsea-front, a fair-haired young lady of medium height, wearing a _béret_;\r\na white Pomeranian dog was running behind her.\r\n\r\nAnd afterwards he met her in the public gardens and in the square\r\nseveral times a day. She was walking alone, always wearing the same\r\n_béret_, and always with the same white dog; no one knew who she was,\r\nand every one called her simply \"the lady with the dog.\"\r\n\r\n\"If she is here alone without a husband or friends, it wouldn't be amiss\r\nto make her acquaintance,\" Gurov reflected.\r\n\r\nHe was under forty, but he had a daughter already twelve years old, and\r\ntwo sons at school. He had been married young, when he was a student in\r\nhis second year, and by now his wife seemed half as old again as he. She\r\nwas a tall, erect woman with dark eyebrows, staid and dignified, and, as\r\nshe said of herself, intellectual. She read a great deal, used phonetic\r\nspelling, called her husband, not Dmitri, but Dimitri, and he secretly\r\nconsidered her unintelligent, narrow, inelegant, was afraid of her, and\r\ndid not like to be at home. He had begun being unfaithful to her long\r\nago--had been unfaithful to her often, and, probably on that account,\r\nalmost always spoke ill of women, and when they were talked about in his\r\npresence, used to call them \"the lower race.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him that he had been so schooled by bitter experience that\r\nhe might call them what he liked, and yet he could not get on for two\r\ndays together without \"the lower race.\" In the society of men he was\r\nbored and not himself, with them he was cold and uncommunicative; but\r\nwhen he was in the company of women he felt free, and knew what to say\r\nto them and how to behave; and he was at ease with them even when he was\r\nsilent. In his appearance, in his character, in his whole nature, there\r\nwas something attractive and elusive which allured women and disposed\r\nthem in his favour; he knew that, and some force seemed to draw him,\r\ntoo, to them.\r\n\r\nExperience often repeated, truly bitter experience, had taught him long\r\nago that with decent people, especially Moscow people--always slow to\r\nmove and irresolute--every intimacy, which at first so agreeably\r\ndiversifies life and appears a light and charming adventure, inevitably\r\ngrows into a regular problem of extreme intricacy, and in the long run\r\nthe situation becomes unbearable. But at every fresh meeting with an\r\ninteresting woman this experience seemed to slip out of his memory, and\r\nhe was eager for life, and everything seemed simple and amusing.\r\n\r\nOne evening he was dining in the gardens, and the lady in the _béret_\r\ncame up slowly to take the next table. Her expression, her gait, her\r\ndress, and the way she did her hair told him that she was a lady, that\r\nshe was married, that she was in Yalta for the first time and alone, and\r\nthat she was dull there.... The stories told of the immorality in such\r\nplaces as Yalta are to a great extent untrue; he despised them, and knew\r\nthat such stories were for the most part made up by persons who would\r\nthemselves have been glad to sin if they had been able; but when the\r\nlady sat down at the next table three paces from him, he remembered\r\nthese tales of easy conquests, of trips to the mountains, and the\r\ntempting thought of a swift, fleeting love affair, a romance with an\r\nunknown woman, whose name he did not know, suddenly took possession of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe beckoned coaxingly to the Pomeranian, and when the dog came up to him\r\nhe shook his finger at it. The Pomeranian growled: Gurov shook his\r\nfinger at it again.\r\n\r\nThe lady looked at him and at once dropped her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"He doesn't bite,\" she said, and blushed.\r\n\r\n\"May I give him a bone?\" he asked; and when she nodded he asked\r\ncourteously, \"Have you been long in Yalta?\"\r\n\r\n\"Five days.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I have already dragged out a fortnight here.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a brief silence.\r\n\r\n\"Time goes fast, and yet it is so dull here!\" she said, not looking at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"That's only the fashion to say it is dull here. A provincial will live\r\nin Belyov or Zhidra and not be dull, and when he comes here it's 'Oh,\r\nthe dulness! Oh, the dust!' One would think he came from Grenada.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed. Then both continued eating in silence, like strangers, but\r\nafter dinner they walked side by side; and there sprang up between them\r\nthe light jesting conversation of people who are free and satisfied, to\r\nwhom it does not matter where they go or what they talk about. They\r\nwalked and talked of the strange light on the sea: the water was of a\r\nsoft warm lilac hue, and there was a golden streak from the moon upon\r\nit. They talked of how sultry it was after a hot day. Gurov told her\r\nthat he came from Moscow, that he had taken his degree in Arts, but had\r\na post in a bank; that he had trained as an opera-singer, but had given\r\nit up, that he owned two houses in Moscow.... And from her he learnt\r\nthat she had grown up in Petersburg, but had lived in S---- since her\r\nmarriage two years before, that she was staying another month in Yalta,\r\nand that her husband, who needed a holiday too, might perhaps come and\r\nfetch her. She was not sure whether her husband had a post in a Crown\r\nDepartment or under the Provincial Council--and was amused by her own\r\nignorance. And Gurov learnt, too, that she was called Anna Sergeyevna.\r\n\r\nAfterwards he thought about her in his room at the hotel--thought she\r\nwould certainly meet him next day; it would be sure to happen. As he got\r\ninto bed he thought how lately she had been a girl at school, doing\r\nlessons like his own daughter; he recalled the diffidence, the\r\nangularity, that was still manifest in her laugh and her manner of\r\ntalking with a stranger.

I was trustee for his wife and executor at his death. He died of a lingering illness, during which his hopes of living were alternately raised, and depressed. Two years before he died, he gave me a huge parcel carefully tied up and sealed. Take care of, but don't open this he said: if I get better, return it to me, if I die, let no mortal eye but yours see it, and burn it.\r\n\r\nHis widow died a year after him. I had well nigh forgoten this packet which I had had full three years, when looking for some title deeds I came cross it, and opened it, as it was my duty to do. Its contents astonished me. The more I read it, the more marvellous it seemed. I pondered long on the meaning of his instructions when he gave it to me, and kept the manuscript some years, hesitating what to do with it.\r\n\r\nAt length I came to the conclusion knowing his idiosyncracy well, that his fear was only lest any one should know who the writer was; and feeling that it would be sinful to destroy such a history, I copied the manuscript and destroyed the original. He died relationless.\r\n\r\nNo one now can trace the author, no names are mentioned in the book, though they were given freely in the margin of his manuscript, and I alone know to whom the initials refer. If I have done harm in printing it, I have done none to him, have indeed only carried out his evident intention, and given to a few a secret history, which bears the impress of truth on every page, a contribution to psychology.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n I began these memoirs when about twenty-five years old, having from youth kept a diary of some sort, which perhaps from habit made me think of recording my inner and secret life.\r\n\r\nWhen I began it, I had scarcely read a baudy book, none of which excepting \"Fanny Hill\" appeared to me to be truthful, that did, and it does so still; the others telling of recherche eroticisms, or of inordinate copulative powers, of the strange twists, tricks, and fancies, of matured voluptuousness, and philosophical lewdness, seemed to my comparative ignorance, as baudy imaginings, or lying inventions, not worthy of belief; although I now know by experience, that they may be true enough, however eccentric, and improbable, they may appear to the uninitiated.\r\n\r\nFanny Hill was a woman's experience. Written perhaps by a woman, where was a man's, written with equal truth? That book has no baudy word in it; but baudy acts need the baudy ejaculations; the erotic, full flavored expressions, which even the chastest indulge in, when lust, or love, is in its full tide of performance. So I determined to write my private life freely as to fact, and in the spirit of the lustful acts done by me, or witnessed; it is written therefore with absolute truth, and without any regard whatever for what the world calls decency. Decency and voluptuousness in its fullest acceptance, cannot exist together, one would kill the other; the poetry of copulation I have only experienced with a few women, which however neither prevented them, nor me from calling a spade, a spade.\r\n\r\nI began it for my amusement; when many years had been chronicled I tired of it and ceased. Some ten years afterwards I met a woman, with whom, or with those she helped me do; I did, said, saw, and heard, well nigh everything a man and woman could do with their genitals, and began to narrate those events, when quite fresh in my memory, a great variety of incidents extending over four years or more. Then I lost sight of her, and my amorous amusements for a while were simpler, but that part of my history was complete.\r\n\r\nAfter a little while, I set to work to describe the events of the intervening years of my youth, and early middle age; which included most of my gallant intrigues and adventures of a frisky order; but not the more lascivious ones of later years. Then an illness caused me to think seriously of burning the whole. But not liking to destroy my labor, I laid it aside again for a couple of years. Then another illness gave me long uninterrupted leisure; I read my manuscript, and filled in some occurrences which I had forgotten, but which my diary enabled me to place in their proper order. This will account for the difference in style in places, which I now observe; and a very needless repetition, of voluptuous descriptions, which I had forgotten, had been before described; that however is inevitable, for human copulation, vary the incidents leading up to it as you may, is, and must be, at all times, much the same affair.\r\n\r\nThen for the first time, I thought I would print my work that had been commenced more than twenty years before, but hesitated. I then had entered my maturity, and on to the most lascivious portion of my life, the events were disjointed, and fragmentary and my amusement was to describe them just after they occurred. Most frequently the next day I wrote all down with much prolixity, since, I have much abbreviated it.\r\n\r\nI had from youth an excellent memory, but about sexual matters a wonderful one. Women were the pleasure of my life. I loved cunt, but also she who had it; I like the woman I fucked and not simply the cunt I fucked, and therein is a great difference. I recollect even now in a degree which astonishes me, the face, color, stature, thighs, backside, and cunt, of well nigh every woman I have had, who was not a mere casual; and even of some who were. The clothes they wore, the houses and rooms in which I had them, were before me mentally, as I wrote, the way the bed, and furniture were placed, the side of the room the windows were on, I remembered perfectly; and all the important events I can fix as to time, sufficiently nearly by reference to my diary, in which the contemporaneous circumstances of my life are recorded.\r\n\r\nI recollect also largely what we said, and did, and generally our baudy amusements. Where I fail to have done so, I have left description blank, rather than attempt to make a story coherent by inserting what was merely probable. I could not now account for my course of action, nor why I did this, or said that, my conduct seems strange, foolish, absurd, very frequently, that of some women, equally so, but I can but state what did occur.\r\n\r\nIn a few cases, I have for what ev","extract":" had been at school and college together, and our intimacy had never been broken.

The Period\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the best of times,\r\nit was the worst of times,\r\nit was the age of wisdom,\r\nit was the age of foolishness,\r\nit was the epoch of belief,\r\nit was the epoch of incredulity,\r\nit was the season of Light,\r\nit was the season of Darkness,\r\nit was the spring of hope,\r\nit was the winter of despair,\r\nwe had everything before us,\r\nwe had nothing before us,\r\nwe were all going direct to Heaven,\r\nwe were all going direct the other way--\r\nin short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of\r\nits noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for\r\nevil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.\r\n\r\nThere were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the\r\nthrone of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen with\r\na fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer\r\nthan crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes,\r\nthat things in general were settled for ever.\r\n\r\nIt was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.\r\nSpiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period,\r\nas at this. Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth\r\nblessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had\r\nheralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were\r\nmade for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane\r\nghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its\r\nmessages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally\r\ndeficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the\r\nearthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People,\r\nfrom a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange\r\nto relate, have proved more important to the human race than any\r\ncommunications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane\r\nbrood.\r\n\r\nFrance, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her\r\nsister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down\r\nhill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her\r\nChristian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane\r\nachievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue\r\ntorn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not\r\nkneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks\r\nwhich passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty\r\nyards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and\r\nNorway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death,\r\nalready marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into\r\nboards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in\r\nit, terrible in history. It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses\r\nof some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were\r\nsheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with\r\nrustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which\r\nthe Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of\r\nthe Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work\r\nunceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about\r\nwith muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion\r\nthat they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous.\r\n\r\nIn England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to\r\njustify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and\r\nhighway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night;\r\nfamilies were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing\r\ntheir furniture to upholsterers' warehouses for security; the highwayman\r\nin the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and\r\nchallenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of\r\n“the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the\r\nmail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and\r\nthen got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the\r\nfailure of his ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace;\r\nthat magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand\r\nand deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the\r\nillustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; p","extract":"udith Boss\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TALE OF TWO CITIES\r\n\r\nA STORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nBy Charles Dickens\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n     Book the First--Recalled to Life\r\n\r\n     Chapter I      The Period\r\n     Chapter II     The Mail\r\n     Chapter III    The Night Shadows\r\n     Chapter IV     The Preparation\r\n     Chapter V      The Wine-shop\r\n     Chapter VI     The Shoemaker\r\n\r\n\r\n     Book the Second--the Golden Thread\r\n\r\n     Chapter I      Five Years Later\r\n     Chapter II     A Sight\r\n     Chapter III    A Disappointment\r\n     Chapter IV     Congratulatory\r\n     Chapter V      The Jackal\r\n     Chapter VI     Hundreds of People\r\n     Chapter VII    Monseigneur in Town\r\n    "},"matches":[{"value":"udith Boss\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TALE OF TWO CITIES\r\n\r\nA STORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nBy Charles Dickens\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n     Book the First--Recalled to Life\r\n\r\n     Chapter I      The Period\r\n     Chapter II     The Mail\r\n     Chapter III    The Night Shadows\r\n     Chapter IV     The Preparation\r\n     Chapter V      The Wine-shop\r\n     Chapter VI     The Shoemaker\r\n\r\n\r\n     Book the Second--the Golden Thread\r\n\r\n     Chapter I      Five Years Later\r\n     Chapter II     A Sight\r\n     Chapter III    A Disappointment\r\n     Chapter IV     Congratulatory\r\n     Chapter V      The Jackal\r\n     Chapter VI     Hundreds of People\r\n     Chapter VII    Monseigneur in Town\r\n    ","key":"extract","arrayIndex":0,"higlights":"udith Boss\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TALE OF TWO CITIES\r\n\r\nA STORY OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTION\r\n\r\nBy Charles Dickens\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n     Book the First--Recalled to Life\r\n\r\n     Chapter I      The Period\r\n     Chapter II     The Mail\r\n     Chapter III    The Night Shadows\r\n     Chapter IV     The Preparation\r\n     Chapter V      The Wine-shop\r\n     Chapter VI     The Shoemaker\r\n\r\n\r\n     Book the Second--the Golden Thread\r\n\r\n     Chapter I      Five Years Later\r\n     Chapter II     A Sight\r\n     Chapter III    A Disappointment\r\n     Chapter IV     Congratulatory\r\n     Chapter V      The Jackal\r\n     Chapter VI     <em>Hu</em>ndreds of People\r\n     Chapter VII    Monseigneur in Town\r\n    "}],"score":0.4004},{"item":{"author":"Dickens, Charles, 1812-1870","title":"A Christmas Carol in Prose; Being a Ghost Story of Christmas","language":"English","subject":"Scrooge, Ebenezer (Fictitious character) -- Fiction","id":"46","downloads":"7943 downloads in the last 30 days.","book":"PROSE\r\nBEING\r\nA Ghost Story of Christmas\r\n\r\nby Charles Dickens\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nI HAVE endeavoured in this Ghostly little book,\r\nto raise the Ghost of an Idea, which shall not put my\r\nreaders out of humour with themselves, with each other,\r\nwith the season, or with me.

There is no doubt\r\nwhatever about that. The register of his burial was\r\nsigned by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker,\r\nand the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it: and\r\nScrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for anything he\r\nchose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a\r\ndoor-nail.\r\n\r\nMind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my\r\nown knowledge, what there is particularly dead about\r\na door-nail. I might have been inclined, myself, to\r\nregard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery\r\nin the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors\r\nis in the simile; and my unhallowed hands\r\nshall not disturb it, or the Country's done for. You\r\nwill therefore permit me to repeat, emphatically, that\r\nMarley was as dead as a door-nail.\r\n\r\nScrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did.\r\nHow could it be otherwise? Scrooge and he were\r\npartners for I don't know how many years. Scrooge\r\nwas his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole\r\nassign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and\r\nsole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully\r\ncut up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent\r\nman of business on the very day of the funeral,\r\nand solemnised it with an undoubted bargain.\r\n\r\nThe mention of Marley's funeral brings me back to\r\nthe point I started from. There is no doubt that Marley\r\nwas dead. This must be distinctly understood, or\r\nnothing wonderful can come of the story I am going\r\nto relate. If we were not perfectly convinced that\r\nHamlet's Father died before the play began, there\r\nwould be nothing more remarkable in his taking a\r\nstroll at night, in an easterly wind, upon his own ramparts,\r\nthan there would be in any other middle-aged\r\ngentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy\r\nspot--say Saint Paul's Churchyard for instance--\r\nliterally to astonish his son's weak mind.\r\n\r\nScrooge never painted out Old Marley's name.\r\nThere it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse\r\ndoor: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as\r\nScrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the\r\nbusiness called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley,\r\nbut he answered to both names. It was all the\r\nsame to him.\r\n\r\nOh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-stone,\r\nScrooge! a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping,\r\nclutching, covetous, old sinner! Hard and sharp as flint,\r\nfrom which no steel had ever struck out generous fire;\r\nsecret, and self-contained, and solitary as an oyster. The\r\ncold within him froze his old features, nipped his pointed\r\nnose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his\r\neyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his\r\ngrating voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his\r\neyebrows, and his wiry chin. He carried his own low\r\ntemperature always about with him; he iced his office in\r\nthe dog-days; and didn't thaw it one degree at Christmas.\r\n\r\nExternal heat and cold had little influence on\r\nScrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather\r\nchill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he,\r\nno falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no\r\npelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather didn't\r\nknow where to have him. The heaviest rain, and\r\nsnow, and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage\r\nover him in only one respect. They often \"came down\"\r\nhandsomely, and Scrooge never did.\r\n\r\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with\r\ngladsome looks, \"My dear Scrooge, how are you?\r\nWhen will you come to see me?\" No beggars implored\r\nhim to bestow a trifle, no children asked him\r\nwhat it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all\r\nhis life inquired the way to such and such a place, of\r\nScrooge. Even the blind men's dogs appeared to\r\nknow him; and when they saw him coming on, would\r\ntug their owners into doorways and up courts; and\r\nthen would wag their tails as though they said, \"No\r\neye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!\"\r\n\r\nBut what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing\r\nhe liked. To edge his way along the crowded paths\r\nof life, warning all human sympathy to keep its distance,\r\nwas what the knowing ones call \"nuts\" to Scrooge.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time--of all the good days in the year,\r\non Christmas Eve--old Scrooge sat busy in his\r\ncounting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy\r\nwithal: and he could hear the people in the court outside,\r\ngo wheezing up and down, beating their hands\r\nupon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the\r\npavement stones to warm them. The city clocks had\r\nonly just gone three, but it was quite dark already--\r\nit had not been light all day--and candles were flaring\r\nin the windows of the neighbouring offices, like\r\nruddy smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog\r\ncame pouring in at every chink and keyhole, and was\r\nso dense without, that although the court was of the\r\nnarrowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms.\r\nTo see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring\r\neverything, one might have thought that Nature\r\nlived hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.\r\n\r\nThe door of Scrooge's counting-house was open\r\nthat he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a\r\ndismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying\r\nletters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's\r\nfire was so very much smaller that it looked like one\r\ncoal. But he couldn't replenish it, for Scrooge kept\r\nthe coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the\r\nclerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted\r\nthat it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore\r\nthe clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to\r\nwarm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being\r\na man of a strong imagination, he failed.\r\n\r\n\"A merry C","extract":"PROSE\r\nBEING\r\nA Ghost Story of Christmas\r\n\r\nby Charles Dickens\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nI HAVE endeavoured in this Ghostly little book,\r\nto raise the Ghost of an Idea, which shall not put my\r\nreaders out of humour with themselves, with each other,\r\nwith the season, or with me.

Marseilles—The Arrival\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde\r\nsignalled the three-master, the Pharaon from Smyrna, Trieste, and\r\nNaples.\r\n\r\nAs usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Château d’If,\r\ngot on board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island.\r\n\r\nImmediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean\r\nwere covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a\r\nship to come into port, especially when this ship, like the Pharaon, has\r\nbeen built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs to an\r\nowner of the city.\r\n\r\nThe ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic\r\nshock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled\r\nPomègue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker, but\r\nso slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is the\r\nforerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have\r\nhappened on board. However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly\r\nthat if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself, for\r\nshe bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the\r\nanchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by\r\nthe side of the pilot, who was steering the Pharaon towards the narrow\r\nentrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity and\r\nvigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each\r\ndirection of the pilot.\r\n\r\nThe vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much\r\naffected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the\r\nvessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled\r\nalongside the Pharaon, which he reached as she rounded into La Réserve\r\nbasin.\r\n\r\nWhen the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his\r\nstation by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship’s bulwarks.\r\n\r\nHe was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with black\r\neyes, and hair as dark as a raven’s wing; and his whole appearance\r\nbespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from\r\ntheir cradle to contend with danger.\r\n\r\n“Ah, is it you, Dantès?” cried the man in the skiff. “What’s the matt","extract":", and\r\nDavid Widger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO\r\n\r\n\r\nby Alexandre Dumas [père]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n0009m\r\n\r\n\r\n0011m\r\n\r\n\r\n0019m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContents\r\n\r\nVOLUME ONE\r\n\r\nChapter 1.

Allez vous-en! Sapristi! That's all right!”\r\n\r\nHe could speak a little Spanish, and also a language which nobody\r\nunderstood, unless it was the mocking-bird that hung on the other\r\nside of the door, whistling his fluty notes out upon the breeze with\r\nmaddening persistence.\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier, unable to read his newspaper with any degree of comfort,\r\narose with an expression and an exclamation of disgust.\r\n\r\nHe walked down the gallery and across the narrow “bridges” which\r\nconnected the Lebrun cottages one with the other. He had been seated\r\nbefore the door of the main house. The parrot and the mockingbird were\r\nthe property of Madame Lebrun, and they had the right to make all the\r\nnoise they wished. Mr. Pontellier had the privilege of quitting their\r\nsociety when they ceased to be entertaining.\r\n\r\nHe stopped before the door of his own cottage, which was the fourth one\r\nfrom the main building and next to the last. Seating himself in a wicker\r\nrocker which was there, he once more applied himself to the task of\r\nreading the newspaper. The day was Sunday; the paper was a day old. The\r\nSunday papers had not yet reached Grand Isle. He was already acquainted\r\nwith the market reports, and he glanced restlessly over the editorials\r\nand bits of news which he had not had time to read before quitting New\r\nOrleans the day before.\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier wore eye-glasses. He was a man of forty, of medium height\r\nand rather slender build; he stooped a little. His hair was brown and\r\nstraight, parted on one side. His beard was neatly and closely trimmed.\r\n\r\nOnce in a while he withdrew his glance from the newspaper and looked\r\nabout him. There was more noise than ever over at the house. The main\r\nbuilding was called “the house,” to distinguish it from the cottages.\r\nThe chattering and whistling birds were still at it. Two young girls,\r\nthe Farival twins, were playing a duet from “Zampa” upon the piano.\r\nMadame Lebrun was bustling in and out, giving orders in a high key to a\r\nyard-boy whenever she got inside the house, and directions in an equally\r\nhigh voice to a dining-room servant whenever she got outside. She was\r\na fresh, pretty woman, clad always in white with elbow sleeves. Her\r\nstarched skirts crinkled as she came and went. Farther down, before\r\none of the cottages, a lady in black was walking demurely up and down,\r\ntelling her beads. A good many persons of the pension had gone over to\r\nthe Cheniere Caminada in Beaudelet's lugger to hear mass. Some young\r\npeople were out under the wateroaks playing croquet. Mr. Pontellier's\r\ntwo children were there--sturdy little fellows of four and five. A\r\nquadroon nurse followed them about with a faraway, meditative air.\r\n\r\nMr. Pontellier finally lit a cigar and began to smoke, letting the paper\r\ndrag idly from his hand. He fixed his gaze upon a white sunshade that\r\nwas advancing at snail's pace from the beach. He could see it plainly\r\nbetween the gaunt trunks of the water-oaks and across the stretch of\r\nyellow camomile. The gulf looked far away, melting hazily into the blue\r\nof the horizon. The sunshade continued to approach slowly. Beneath its\r\npink-lined shelter were his wife, Mrs. Pontellier, and young Robert\r\nLebrun. When they reached the cottage, the two seated themselves with\r\nsome appearance of fatigue upon the upper step of the porch, facing each\r\nother, each leaning against a supporting post.\r\n\r\n“What folly! to bathe at such an hour in such heat!” exclaimed Mr.\r\nPontellier. He himself had taken a plunge at daylight. That was why the\r\nmorning seemed long to him.\r\n\r\n“You are burnt beyond recognition,” he added, looking at his wife as one\r\nlooks at a valuable piece of personal property which has suffered some\r\ndamage. She held up her hands, strong, shapely hands, and surveyed them\r\ncritically, drawing up her fawn sleeves above the wrists. Looking at\r\nthem reminded her of her rings, which she had given to her husband\r\nbefore leaving for the beach. She silently reached out to him, and he,\r\nunderstanding, took the rings from his vest pocket and dropped them\r\ninto her open palm. She slipped them upon her fingers; then clasping\r\nher knees, she looked across at Robert and began to laugh. The rings\r\nsparkled upon her fingers. He sent back an answering smile.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” asked Pontellier, looking lazily and amused from one to\r\nthe other. It was some utter nonsense; some adventure out there in the\r\nwater, and they both tried to relate it at once. It did not seem half\r\nso amusing when told. They realized this, and so did Mr. Pontellier. He\r\nyawned and stretched himself. Then he got up, saying he had half a mind\r\nto go over to Klein's hotel and play a game of billiards.\r\n\r\n“Come go along, Lebrun,” he proposed to Robert. But Robert admitted\r\nquite frankly that he preferred to stay where he was and talk to Mrs.\r\nPontellier.\r\n\r\n“Well, send him about his business when he bores you, Edna,” instructed\r\nher husband as he prepared to leave.\r\n\r\n“Here, take the umbrella,” she exclaimed, holding it out to him. He\r\naccepted the sunshade, and lifting it over his head descended the steps\r\nand walked away.\r\n\r\n“Coming back to dinner?” his wife called after him. He halted a moment\r\nand shrugged his shoulders. He felt in his vest pocket; there was a\r\nten-dollar bill there. He did not know; perhaps he would return for the\r\nearly dinner and perhaps he would not. It all depended upon the company\r\nwhich he found over at Klein's and the size of “the game.” He did not\r\nsay this, but she understood it, and laughed, nodding good-by to him.\r\n\r\nBoth children wanted to follow their father when they saw him starting\r\nout. He kissed them and promised to bring them back bonbons and peanuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Pontellier's eyes were quick and bright; they were a yellowish\r\nbrown, about the color of her hair.

JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE ***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRANGE CASE OF DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE\r\n\r\nby Robert Louis Stevenson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORY OF THE DOOR\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was never\r\nlighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse; backward\r\nin sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow lovable.\r\nAt friendly meetings, and when the wine was to his taste, something\r\neminently human beaconed from his eye; something indeed which never\r\nfound its way into his talk, but which spoke not only in these silent\r\nsymbols of the after-dinner face, but more often and loudly in the acts\r\nof his life. He was austere with himself; drank gin when he was alone,\r\nto mortify a taste for vintages; and though he enjoyed the theatre, had\r\nnot crossed the doors of one for twenty years. But he had an approved\r\ntolerance for others; sometimes wondering, almost with envy, at the high\r\npressure of spirits involved in their misdeeds; and in any extremity\r\ninclined to help rather than to reprove. “I incline to Cain’s heresy,”\r\n he used to say quaintly: “I let my brother go to the devil in his own\r\nway.” In this character, it was frequently his fortune to be the last\r\nreputable acquaintance and the last good influence in the lives of\r\ndowngoing men. And to such as these, so long as they came about his\r\nchambers, he never marked a shade of change in his demeanour.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative\r\nat the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar\r\ncatholicity of good-nature. It is the mark of a modest man to accept his\r\nfriendly circle ready-made from the hands of opportunity; and that was\r\nthe lawyer’s way. His friends were those of his own blood or those whom\r\nhe had known the longest; his affections, like ivy, were the growth of\r\ntime, they implied no aptness in the object. Hence, no doubt the\r\nbond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman, the\r\nwell-known man about town. It was a nut to crack for many, what these\r\ntwo could see in each other, or what subject they could find in common.\r\nIt was reported by those who encountered them in their Sunday walks,\r\nthat they said nothing, looked singularly dull and would hail with\r\nobvious relief the appearance of a friend. For all that, the two men put\r\nthe greatest store by these excursions, counted them the chief jewel\r\nof each week, and not only set aside occasions of pleasure, but\r\neven resisted the calls of business, that they might enjoy them\r\nuninterrupted.\r\n\r\nIt chanced on one of these rambles that their way led them down a\r\nby-street in a busy quarter of London. The street was small and what\r\nis called quiet, but it drove a thriving trade on the weekdays. The\r\ninhabitants were all doing well, it seemed and all emulously hoping to\r\ndo better still, and laying out the surplus of their grains in coquetry;\r\nso that the shop fronts stood along that thoroughfare with an air of\r\ninvitation, like rows of smiling saleswomen. Even on Sunday, when it\r\nveiled its more florid charms and lay comparatively empty of passage,\r\nthe street shone out in contrast to its dingy neighbourhood, like a\r\nfire in a forest; and with its freshly painted shutters, well-polished\r\nbrasses, and general cleanliness and gaiety of note, instantly caught\r\nand pleased the eye of the passenger.\r\n\r\nTwo doors from one corner, on the left hand going east the line was\r\nbroken by the entry of a court; and just at that point a certain\r\nsinister block of building thrust forward its gable on the street. It\r\nwas two storeys high; showed no window, nothing but a door on the lower\r\nstorey and a blind forehead of discoloured wall on the upper; and bore\r\nin every feature, the marks of prolonged and sordid negligence. The\r\ndoor, which was equipped with neither bell nor knocker, was blistered\r\nand distained. Tramps slouched into the recess and struck matches on the\r\npanels; children kept shop upon the steps; the schoolboy had tried\r\nhis knife on the mouldings; and for close on a generation, no one had\r\nappeared to drive away these random visitors or to repair their ravages.\r\n\r\nMr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; but\r\nwhen they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane and\r\npointed.\r\n\r\n“Did you ever remark that door?” he asked; and when his companion had\r\nreplied in the affirmative. “It is connected in my mind,” added he,\r\n“with a very odd story.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed?” said Mr. Utterson, with a slight change of voice, “and what\r\nwas that?”\r\n\r\n“Well, it was this way,” returned Mr. Enfield: “I was coming home from\r\nsome place at the end of the world, about three o’clock of a black\r\nwinter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was\r\nliterally nothing to be seen but lamps. Street after street and all the\r\nfolks asleep--street after street, all lighted up as if for a procession\r\nand all as empty as a church--till at last I got into that state of mind\r\nwhen a man listens and listens and begins to long for the sight of a\r\npoliceman. All at once, I saw two figures: one a little man who was\r\nstumping along eastward at a good walk, and the other a girl of maybe\r\neight or ten who was running as hard as she was able down a cross\r\nstreet. Well, sir, the two ran into one another naturally enough at\r\nthe corner; and then came the horrible part of the thing; for the man\r\ntrampled calmly over the child’s body and left her screaming on the\r\nground. It sounds nothing to hear, but it was hellish to see. It wasn’t\r\nlike a man; it was like some damned Juggernaut. I gave a few halloa,\r\ntook to my heels, collared my gentleman, and brought him back to where\r\nthere was already quite a group about the screaming child. He was\r\nperfectly cool and made no resistance, but gave me one look, so ugly\r\nthat it brought out the sweat on me like running. The people who had\r\nturned out were the girl’s own family; and pretty soon, the doctor, for\r\nwhom she had been sent put in his appearance. Well, the child was not\r\nmuch the worse, more frightened, according to the Sawbones; and there\r\nyou might have supposed would be an end to it. But there was one curious\r\ncircumstance. I had taken a loathing to my gentleman at first sight. So\r\nhad the child’s family, which was only na","extract":". JEKYLL AND MR.

The winged fairies of Grimm and Andersen have brought more\r\nhappiness to childish hearts than all other human creations.\r\n\r\nYet the old time fairy tale, having served for generations, may now be\r\nclassed as \"historical\" in the children's library; for the time has\r\ncome for a series of newer \"wonder tales\" in which the stereotyped\r\ngenie, dwarf and fairy are eliminated, together with all the horrible\r\nand blood-curdling incidents devised by their authors to point a\r\nfearsome moral to each tale.  Modern education includes morality;\r\ntherefore the modern child seeks only entertainment in its wonder tales\r\nand gladly dispenses with all disagreeable incident.\r\n\r\nHaving this thought in mind, the story of \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\"\r\nwas written solely to please children of today.  It aspires to being a\r\nmodernized fairy tale, in which the wonderment and joy are retained and\r\nthe heartaches and nightmares are left out.\r\n\r\n\r\nL. Frank Baum\r\n\r\nChicago, April, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WONDERFUL WIZARD OF OZ\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  The Cyclone\r\n\r\n\r\nDorothy lived in the midst of the great Kansas prairies, with Uncle\r\nHenry, who was a farmer, and Aunt Em, who was the farmer's wife.  Their\r\nhouse was small, for the lumber to build it had to be carried by wagon\r\nmany miles.  There were four walls, a floor and a roof, which made one\r\nroom; and this room contained a rusty looking cookstove, a cupboard for\r\nthe dishes, a table, three or four chairs, and the beds.  Uncle Henry\r\nand Aunt Em had a big bed in one corner, and Dorothy a little bed in\r\nanother corner.  There was no garret at all, and no cellar--except a\r\nsmall hole dug in the ground, called a cyclone cellar, where the family\r\ncould go in case one of those great whirlwinds arose, mighty enough to\r\ncrush any building in its path.  It was reached by a trap door in the\r\nmiddle of the floor, from which a ladder led down into the small, dark\r\nhole.\r\n\r\nWhen Dorothy stood in the doorway and looked around, she could see\r\nnothing but the great gray prairie on every side.  Not a tree nor a\r\nhouse broke the broad sweep of flat country that reached to the edge of\r\nthe sky in all directions.  The sun had baked the plowed land into a\r\ngray mass, with little cracks running through it.  Even the grass was\r\nnot green, for the sun had burned the tops of the long blades until\r\nthey were the same gray color to be seen everywhere.  Once the house\r\nhad been painted, but the sun blistered the paint and the rains washed\r\nit away, and now the house was as dull and gray as everything else.\r\n\r\nWhen Aunt Em came there to live she was a young, pretty wife.  The sun\r\nand wind had changed her, too.  They had taken the sparkle from her\r\neyes and left them a sober gray; they had taken the red from her cheeks\r\nand lips, and they were gray also.  She was thin and gaunt, and never\r\nsmiled now.  When Dorothy, who was an orphan, first came to her, Aunt\r\nEm had been so startled by the child's laughter that she would scream\r\nand press her hand upon her heart whenever Dorothy's merry voice\r\nreached her ears; and she still looked at the little girl with wonder\r\nthat she could find anything to laugh at.\r\n\r\nUncle Henry never laughed.  He worked hard from morning till night and\r\ndid not know what joy was.  He was gray also, from his long beard to\r\nhis rough boots, and he looked stern and solemn, and rarely spoke.\r\n\r\nIt was Toto that made Dorothy laugh, and saved her from growing as gray\r\nas her other surroundings.  Toto was not gray; he was a little black\r\ndog, with long silky hair and small black eyes that twinkled merrily on\r\neither side of his funny, wee nose.  Toto played all day long, and\r\nDorothy played with him, and loved him dearly.\r\n\r\nToday, however, they were not playing.  Uncle Henry sat upon the\r\ndoorstep and looked anxiously at the sky, which was even grayer than\r\nusual.  Dorothy stood in the door with Toto in her arms, and looked at\r\nthe sky too.  Aunt Em was washing the dishes.\r\n\r\nFrom the far north they heard a low wail of the wind, and Uncle Henry\r\nand Dorothy could see where the long grass bowed in waves before the\r\ncoming storm.  There now came a sharp whistling in the air from the\r\nsouth, and as they turned their eyes that way they saw ripples in the\r\ngrass coming from that direction also.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Uncle Henry stood up.\r\n\r\n\"There's a cyclone coming, Em,\" he called to his wife.  \"I'll go look\r\nafter the stock.\"  Then he ran toward the sheds where the cows and\r\nhorses were kept.\r\n\r\nAunt Em dropped her work and came to the door.  One glance told her of\r\nthe danger close at hand.\r\n\r\n\"Quick, Dorothy!\" she screamed.  \"Run for the cellar!\"\r\n\r\nToto jumped out of Dorothy's arms and hid under the bed, and the girl\r\nstarted to get him.  Aunt Em, badly frightened, threw open the trap\r\ndoor in the floor and climbed down the ladder into the small, dark\r\nhole.  Dorothy caught Toto at last and started to follow her aunt.\r\nWhen she was halfway across the room there came a great shriek from the\r\nwind, and the house shook so hard that she lost her footing and sat\r\ndown suddenly upon the floor.\r\n\r\nThen a strange thing happened.\r\n\r\nThe house whirled around two or three times and rose slowly through the\r\nair.  Dorothy felt as if she were going up in a balloon.\r\n\r\nThe north and south winds met where th","extract":"\n   2.  The Council with the Munchkins\r\n   3.

This name was given, we are told, in\r\nformer days, by the good housewives of the adjacent country, from the\r\ninveterate propensity of their husbands to linger about the village\r\ntavern on market days. Be that as it may, I do not vouch for the fact,\r\nbut merely advert to it, for the sake of being precise and authentic.\r\nNot far from this village, perhaps about two miles, there is a little\r\nvalley or rather lap of land among high hills, which is one of the\r\nquietest places in the whole world. A small brook glides through it,\r\nwith just murmur enough to lull one to repose; and the occasional\r\nwhistle of a quail or tapping of a woodpecker is almost the only sound\r\nthat ever breaks in upon the uniform tranquillity.\r\n\r\nI recollect that, when a stripling, my first exploit in\r\nsquirrel-shooting was in a grove of tall walnut-trees that shades one\r\nside of the valley. I had wandered into it at noontime, when all nature\r\nis peculiarly quiet, and was startled by the roar of my own gun, as it\r\nbroke the Sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated\r\nby the angry echoes. If ever I should wish for a retreat whither I might\r\nsteal from the world and its distractions, and dream quietly away the\r\nremnant of a troubled life, I know of none more promising than this\r\nlittle valley.\r\n\r\nFrom the listless repose of the place, and the peculiar character of its\r\ninhabitants, who are descendants from the original Dutch settlers, this\r\nsequestered glen has long been known by the name of SLEEPY HOLLOW, and\r\nits rustic lads are called the Sleepy Hollow Boys throughout all the\r\nneighboring country. A drowsy, dreamy influence seems to hang over the\r\nland, and to pervade the very atmosphere. Some say that the place\r\nwas bewitched by a High German doctor, during the early days of the\r\nsettlement; others, that an old Indian chief, the prophet or wizard of\r\nhis tribe, held his powwows there before the country was discovered by\r\nMaster Hendrick Hudson. Certain it is, the place still continues under\r\nthe sway of some witching power, that holds a spell over the minds of\r\nthe good people, causing them to walk in a continual reverie. They are\r\ngiven to all kinds of marvellous beliefs, are subject to trances and\r\nvisions, and frequently see strange sights, and hear music and voices in\r\nthe air. The whole neighborhood abounds with local tales, haunted spots,\r\nand twilight superstitions; stars shoot and meteors glare oftener across\r\nthe valley than in any other part of the country, and the nightmare,\r\nwith her whole ninefold, seems to make it the favorite scene of her\r\ngambols.\r\n\r\nThe dominant spirit, however, that haunts this enchanted region, and\r\nseems to be commander-in-chief of all the powers of the air, is the\r\napparition of a figure on horseback, without a head. It is said by some\r\nto be the ghost of a Hessian trooper, whose head had been carried away\r\nby a cannon-ball, in some nameless battle during the Revolutionary War,\r\nand who is ever and anon seen by the country folk hurrying along in\r\nthe gloom of night, as if on the wings of the wind. His haunts are not\r\nconfined to the valley, but extend at times to the adjacent roads, and\r\nespecially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance. Indeed,\r\ncertain of the most authentic historians of those parts, who have been\r\ncareful in collecting and collating the floating facts concerning this\r\nspectre, allege that the body of the trooper having been buried in the\r\nchurchyard, the ghost rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly\r\nquest of his head, and that the rushing speed with which he sometimes\r\npasses along the Hollow, like a midnight blast, is owing to his being\r\nbelated, and in a hurry to get back to the churchyard before daybreak.\r\n\r\nSuch is the general purport of this legendary superstition, which has\r\nfurnished materials for many a wild story in that region of shadows; and\r\nthe spectre is known at all the country firesides, by the name of the\r\nHeadless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the visionary propensity I have mentioned is not\r\nconfined to the native inhabitants of the valley, but is unconsciously\r\nimbibed by every one who resides there for a time. However wide awake\r\nthey may have been before they entered that sleepy region, they are\r\nsure, in a little time, to inhale the witching influence of the air, and\r\nbegin to grow imaginative, to dream dreams, and see apparitions.\r\n\r\nI mention this peaceful spot with all possible laud, for it is in such\r\nlittle retired Dutch valleys, found here and there embosomed in the\r\ngreat State of New York, that population, manners, and customs remain\r\nfixed, while the great torrent of migration and improvement, which is\r\nmaking such incessant changes in other parts of this restless country,\r\nsweeps by them unobserved. They are like those little nooks of still\r\nwater, which border a rapid stream, where we may see the straw and\r\nbubble riding quietly at anchor, or slowly revolving in their mimic\r\nharbor, undisturbed by the rush of the passing current. Though many\r\nyears have elapsed since I trod the drowsy shades of Sleepy Hollow, yet\r\nI question whether I should not still find the same trees and the same\r\nfamilies vegetating in its sheltered bosom.\r\n\r\nIn this by-place of nature there abode, in a remote period of American\r\nhistory, that is to say, some thirty years since, a worthy wight of the\r\nname of Ichabod Crane, who sojourned, or, as","extract":"nd Greg Newby\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW\r\n\r\n\r\nby Washington Irving\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUND AMONG THE PAPERS OF THE LATE DIEDRICH KNICKERBOCKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n        A pleasing land of drowsy head it was,\r\n          Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye;\r\n        And of gay castles in the clouds that pass,\r\n          Forever flushing round a summer sky.\r\n                                         CASTLE OF INDOLENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the bosom of one of those spacious coves which indent the eastern\r\nshore of the Hudson, at that broad expansion of the river denominated\r\nby the ancient Dutch navigators the Tappan Zee, and where they always\r\nprudently shortened sail and implored the"},"matches":[],"score":0.4004},{"item":{"author":"Alcott, Louisa May, 1832-1888","title":"Little Women","language":"English","subject":"March family (Fictitious characters) -- Fiction","id":"514","downloads":"4337 downloads in the last 30 days.","book":"LAYING PILGRIMS\r\n          TWO  A MERRY CHRISTMAS\r\n        THREE  THE LAURENCE BOY\r\n         FOUR  BURDENS\r\n         FIVE  BEING NEIGHBORLY\r\n          SIX  BETH FINDS THE PALACE BEAUTIFUL\r\n        SEVEN  AMY'S VALLEY OF HUMILIATION\r\n        EIGHT  JO MEETS APOLLYON\r\n         NINE  MEG GOES TO VANITY FAIR\r\n          TEN  THE P.C.

We can't do much, but we can make our little sacrifices, and\r\nought to do it gladly.  But I am afraid I don't,\" and Meg shook her\r\nhead, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted.\r\n\r\n\"But I don't think the little we should spend would do any good.  We've\r\neach got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped by our giving\r\nthat.  I agree not to expect anything from Mother or you, but I do want\r\nto buy _Undine and Sintran_ for myself.  I've wanted it so long,\" said\r\nJo, who was a bookworm.\r\n\r\n\"I planned to spend mine in new music,\" said Beth, with a little sigh,\r\nwhich no one heard but the hearth brush and kettle-holder.\r\n\r\n\"I shall get a nice box of Faber's drawing pencils; I really need\r\nthem,\" said Amy decidedly.\r\n\r\n\"Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't wish us to\r\ngive up everything.  Let's each buy what we want, and have a little\r\nfun; I'm sure we work hard enough to earn it,\" cried Jo, examining the\r\nheels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.\r\n\r\n\"I know I do--teaching those tiresome children nearly all day, when I'm\r\nlonging to enjoy myself at home,\" began Meg, in the complaining tone\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"You don't have half such a hard time as I do,\" said Jo. \"How would you\r\nlike to be shut up for hours with a nervous, fussy old lady, who keeps\r\nyou trotting, is never satisfied, and worries you till you're ready to\r\nfly out the window or cry?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and keeping things\r\ntidy is the worst work in the world.  It makes me cross, and my hands\r\nget so stiff, I can't practice well at all.\" And Beth looked at her\r\nrough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe any of you suffer as I do,\" cried Amy, \"for you don't\r\nhave to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you\r\ndon't know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your\r\nfather if he isn't rich, and insult you when your nose isn't nice.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you mean libel, I'd say so, and not talk about labels, as if Papa\r\nwas a pickle bottle,\" advised Jo, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"I know what I mean, and you needn't be statirical about it. It's\r\nproper to use good words, and improve your vocabilary,\" returned Amy,\r\nwith dignity.\r\n\r\n\"Don't peck at one another, children.  Don't you wish we had the money\r\nPapa lost when we were little, Jo?  Dear me! How happy and good we'd\r\nbe, if we had no worries!\" said Meg, who could remember better times.\r\n\r\n\"You said the other day you thought we were a deal happier than the\r\nKing children, for they were fighting and fretting all the time, in\r\nspite of their money.\"\r\n\r\n\"So I did, Beth.  Well, I think we are.  For though we do have to work,\r\nwe make fun of ourselves, and are a pretty jolly set, as Jo would say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Jo does use such slang words!\" observed Amy, with a reproving look at\r\nthe long figure stretched on the rug.\r\n\r\nJo immediately sat up, put her hands in her pockets, and began to\r\nwhistle.\r\n\r\n\"Don't, Jo.  It's so boyish!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's why I do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I detest rude, unladylike girls!\"\r\n\r\n\"I hate affected, niminy-piminy chits!\"\r\n\r\n\"Birds in their little nests agree,\" sang Beth, the peacemaker, with\r\nsuch a funny face that both sharp voices softened to a laugh, and the\r\n\"pecking\" ended for that time.\r\n\r\n\"Really, girls, you are both to be blamed,\" said Meg, beginning to\r\nlecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. \"You are old enough to leave off\r\nboyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine.  It didn't matter so\r\nmuch when you were a little girl, but now you are so tall, and turn up\r\nyour hair, you should remember that you are a young lady.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not!   And if turning up my hair makes me one, I'll wear it in two\r\ntails till I'm twenty,\" cried Jo, pulling off her net, and","extract":"LAYING PILGRIMS\r\n          TWO  A MERRY CHRISTMAS\r\n        THREE  THE LAURENCE BOY\r\n         FOUR  BURDENS\r\n         FIVE  BEING NEIGHBORLY\r\n          SIX  BETH FINDS THE PALACE BEAUTIFUL\r\n        SEVEN  AMY'S VALLEY OF HUMILIATION\r\n        EIGHT  JO MEETS APOLLYON\r\n         NINE  MEG GOES TO VANITY FAIR\r\n          TEN  THE P.C.

The coolie vanished into the shadows of\r\nthe palm trees.\r\n\r\n“What’s the big idea?” The sergeant in command of the anti-aircraft gun\r\nsat up. The air of India was hot and moist that afternoon. He had been\r\nhalf asleep. Now he stared at the cart and its odd contents and then\r\nsent a second questioning look at the girl with the wind-blown hair.\r\n\r\n“You and I are going to do a little practicing.” The girl spoke in a\r\nsteady even tone. Then she smiled.\r\n\r\nThe sergeant looked her up and down. She was, he decided one of those\r\nrare girls who could make even the drab uniform of a WAC look good. She\r\nwas rather large but well proportioned. “An oversize copy of a beautiful\r\ngal,” he told himself.\r\n\r\nTo the girl, after recalling her words, he said:\r\n\r\n“Says who?”\r\n\r\n“Says the Colonel.” Smiling a little more broadly she fished a crumpled\r\nbit of paper from her pocket and handed it to him.\r\n\r\n“Military papers,” he grumbled as he smoothed out the sheet. “Should be\r\nkept in perfect condition, folded neatly.”\r\n\r\n“And read.” She did not smile.\r\n\r\n“Okay—okay, sister. All the same, that’s general orders I’m giving you.\r\nI—”\r\n\r\nHe broke off to stare at the paper. “What’s this?” He glared at the\r\npaper some more. “You are to send small balloons carrying hollow steel\r\nballs up into the sky. Then you are to find them up there in the clouds\r\nand I am to try and shoot them down?”\r\n\r\n“That’s right.”\r\n\r\n“What’s this? A new game for a soldier’s pastime in a strange and\r\nforeign land?” He stared at her afresh.\r\n\r\n“Ever hear of radar?” she asked.\r\n\r\n“Sure! They use it in the Navy.”\r\n\r\n“They do. And they’ll use it in the Army too, providing it is possible\r\nto get the co-operation of the Army sergeants in charge of anti-aircraft\r\nguns.”\r\n\r\n“Meaning me? Okay. You win,” he agreed with an unwilling grin. “But\r\nthere’s one line in this paper that is coo-coo. It should say that you\r\nare to try and find those steel balls in the clouds and I’m to shoot ’em\r\ndown.”\r\n\r\n“Wait and see.” She stood her ground.\r\n\r\nThe coolie returned with one end of the electric cord. She connected it\r\nto the box on the cart. Something began to burn. Some tubes lighted up.\r\n\r\n“Now,” she sighed. “It’s hot, don’t you think?”\r\n\r\n“What? That thing? I wouldn’t know,” he said.\r\n\r\n“No. The weather,” she replied.\r\n\r\n“Terrible!” he agreed with conviction. “Just at the end of the rainy\r\nseason! It’s awful having your rest period broken into by a gal in an\r\narmy uniform.” He winked at the two buck privates who helped man his\r\ngun, and they laughed.\r\n\r\nPaying not the least attention to this unflattering bit of drama, the\r\ngirl went about her work. Removing a short steel tube from the cart, she\r\nconnected it with a large paper balloon, then turned on a valve. A\r\nhissing sound followed. The balloon inflated rapidly and pulled at the\r\ncord that held it to the cart. After attaching a metal ball about a foot\r\nin diameter to the balloon, she allowed it to float skyward. It rose\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nSquinting his eyes, the sergeant said: “You expect me to hit t","extract":"\r\n*** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK SECRETS OF RADAR ***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProduced by Stephen Hutcheson and the Online Distributed\r\nProofreading Team at http://www.pgdp.net\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _Secrets of_\r\n                                 RADAR\r\n\r\n\r\n                            BY ROY J.

There were no servants present, and the\r\ngentlemen, with chairs closely approaching, seemed to be discussing some\r\nsubject with great earnestness.\r\n\r\nFor convenience sake, we have said, hitherto, two _gentlemen_. One of\r\nthe parties, however, when critically examined, did not seem, strictly\r\nspeaking, to come under the species. He was a short, thick-set man,\r\nwith coarse, commonplace features, and that swaggering air of pretension\r\nwhich marks a low man who is trying to elbow his way upward in the\r\nworld. He was much over-dressed, in a gaudy vest of many colors, a blue\r\nneckerchief, bedropped gayly with yellow spots, and arranged with a\r\nflaunting tie, quite in keeping with the general air of the man. His\r\nhands, large and coarse, were plentifully bedecked with rings; and he\r\nwore a heavy gold watch-chain, with a bundle of seals of portentous\r\nsize, and a great variety of colors, attached to it,--which, in the\r\nardor of conversation, he was in the habit of flourishing and jingling\r\nwith evident satisfaction. His conversation was in free and easy\r\ndefiance of Murray’s Grammar,* and was garnished at convenient intervals\r\nwith various profane expressions, which not even the desire to be\r\ngraphic in our account shall induce us to transcribe.\r\n\r\n     * English Grammar (1795), by Lindley Murray (1745-1826), the\r\n     most authoritative American grammarian of his day.\r\n\r\nHis companion, Mr. Shelby, had the appearance of a gentleman; and the\r\narrangements of the house, and the general air of the housekeeping,\r\nindicated easy, and even opulent circumstances. As we before stated, the\r\ntwo were in the midst of an earnest conversation.\r\n\r\n“That is the way I should arrange the matter,” said Mr. Shelby.\r\n\r\n“I can’t make trade that way--I positively can’t, Mr. Shelby,” said the\r\nother, holding up a glass of wine between his eye and the light.\r\n\r\n“Why, the fact is, Haley, Tom is an uncommon fellow; he is certainly\r\nworth that sum anywhere,--steady, honest, capable, manages my whole farm\r\nlike a clock.”\r\n\r\n“You mean honest, as niggers go,” said Haley, helping himself to a glass\r\nof brandy.\r\n\r\n“No; I mean, really, Tom is a good, steady, sensible, pious fellow. He\r\ngot religion at a camp-meeting, four years ago; and I believe he\r\nreally _did_ get it. I’ve trusted him, since then, with everything I\r\nhave,--money, house, horses,--and let him come and go round the country;\r\nand I always found him true and square in everything.”\r\n\r\n“Some folks don’t believe there is pious niggers Shelby,” said Haley,\r\nwith a candid flourish of his hand, “but _I do_. I had a fellow, now,\r\nin this yer last lot I took to Orleans--‘t was as good as a meetin, now,\r\nreally, to hear that critter pray; and he was quite gentle and quiet\r\nlike. He fetched me a good sum, too, for I bought him cheap of a man\r\nthat was ’bliged to sell out; so I realized six hundred on him. Yes, I\r\nconsider religion a valeyable thing in a nigger, when it’s the genuine\r\narticle, and no mistake.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Tom’s got the real article, if ever a fellow had,” rejoined the\r\nother. “Why, last fall, I let him go to Cincinnati alone, to do business\r\nfor me, and bring home five hundred dollars. ‘Tom,’ says I to him,\r\n‘I trust you, because I think you’re a Christian--I know you wouldn’t\r\ncheat.’ Tom comes back, sure enough; I knew he would. Some low fellows,\r\nthey say, said to him--Tom, why don’t you make tracks for Canada?’ ’Ah,\r\nmaster trusted me, and I couldn’t,’--they told me about it. I am sorry\r\nto part with Tom, I must say. You ought to let him cover the whole\r\nbalance of the debt; and you would, Haley, if you had any conscience.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I’ve got just as much conscience as any man in business can\r\nafford to keep,--just a little, you know, to swear by, as ’t were,” said\r\nthe trader, jocularly; “and, then, I’m ready to do anything in reason\r\nto ’blige friends; but this yer, you see, is a leetle too hard on a\r\nfellow--a leetle too hard.” The trader sighed contemplatively, and\r\npoured out some more brandy.\r\n\r\n“Well, then, Haley, how will you trade?” said Mr. Shelby, after an\r\nuneasy interval of silence.\r\n\r\n“Well, haven’t you a boy or gal that you could throw in with Tom?”\r\n\r\n“Hum!--none that I could well spare; to tell the truth, it’s only hard\r\nnecessity makes me willing to sell at all. I don’t like parting with any\r\nof my hands, that’s a fact.”\r\n\r\nHere the door opened, and a small quadroon boy, between four and five\r\nyears of age, entered the room. There was something in his appearance\r\nremarkably beautiful and engaging. His black hair, fine as floss silk,\r\nhung in glossy curls about his round, dimpled face, while a pair of\r\nlarge dark eyes, full of fire and softness, looked out from beneath the\r\nrich, long lashes, as he peered curiously into the apartment. A gay robe\r\nof scarlet and yellow plaid, carefully made and neatly fitted, set off\r\nto advantage the dark and rich style of his beauty; and a certain comic\r\nair of assurance, blended with bashfulness, showed that he had been not\r\nunused to being petted and noticed by his master.\r\n\r\n“Hulloa, Jim Crow!” said Mr. Shelby, whistling, and snapping a bunch of\r\nraisins towards him, “pick that up, now!”\r\n\r\nThe child scampered, with all his little strength, after the prize,\r\nwhile his master laughed.\r\n\r\n“Come here, Jim Crow,” said he. The child came up, and the master patted\r\nthe curly head, and chucked him under the chin.\r\n\r\n“Now, Jim, show this gentleman how you can dance and sing.” The boy\r\ncommenced one of those wild, grotesque songs common among the negroes,\r\nin a rich, clear voice, accompanying his singing with many comic\r\nevolutions of the hands, feet, and whole body, all in perfect time to\r\nthe music.\r\n\r\n“Bravo!” said Haley, throwing him a quarter of an orange.\r\n\r\n“Now, Jim, walk like old Uncle Cudjoe, when he has the rheumatism,” said\r\nhis master.\r\n\r\nInstantly the flexible limbs of the child assumed the appearance of\r\ndeformity and distortion, as, wit","extract":"nd David Widger\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNCLE TOM’S CABIN\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nLife among the Lowly\r\n\r\n\r\nBy Harriet Beecher Stowe\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOLUME I\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nIn Which the Reader Is Introduced to a Man of Humanity\r\n\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon of a chilly day in February, two gentlemen were\r\nsitting alone over their wine, in a well-furnished dining parlor, in\r\nthe town of P----, in Kentucky.

Dmitri Dmitritch Gurov, who had by then been a fortnight\r\nat Yalta, and so was fairly at home there, had begun to take an interest\r\nin new arrivals. Sitting in Verney's pavilion, he saw, walking on the\r\nsea-front, a fair-haired young lady of medium height, wearing a _béret_;\r\na white Pomeranian dog was running behind her.\r\n\r\nAnd afterwards he met her in the public gardens and in the square\r\nseveral times a day. She was walking alone, always wearing the same\r\n_béret_, and always with the same white dog; no one knew who she was,\r\nand every one called her simply \"the lady with the dog.\"\r\n\r\n\"If she is here alone without a husband or friends, it wouldn't be amiss\r\nto make her acquaintance,\" Gurov reflected.\r\n\r\nHe was under forty, but he had a daughter already twelve years old, and\r\ntwo sons at school. He had been married young, when he was a student in\r\nhis second year, and by now his wife seemed half as old again as he. She\r\nwas a tall, erect woman with dark eyebrows, staid and dignified, and, as\r\nshe said of herself, intellectual. She read a great deal, used phonetic\r\nspelling, called her husband, not Dmitri, but Dimitri, and he secretly\r\nconsidered her unintelligent, narrow, inelegant, was afraid of her, and\r\ndid not like to be at home. He had begun being unfaithful to her long\r\nago--had been unfaithful to her often, and, probably on that account,\r\nalmost always spoke ill of women, and when they were talked about in his\r\npresence, used to call them \"the lower race.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him that he had been so schooled by bitter experience that\r\nhe might call them what he liked, and yet he could not get on for two\r\ndays together without \"the lower race.\" In the society of men he was\r\nbored and not himself, with them he was cold and uncommunicative; but\r\nwhen he was in the company of women he felt free, and knew what to say\r\nto them and how to behave; and he was at ease with them even when he was\r\nsilent. In his appearance, in his character, in his whole nature, there\r\nwas something attractive and elusive which allured women and disposed\r\nthem in his favour; he knew that, and some force seemed to draw him,\r\ntoo, to them.\r\n\r\nExperience often repeated, truly bitter experience, had taught him long\r\nago that with decent people, especially Moscow people--always slow to\r\nmove and irresolute--every intimacy, which at first so agreeably\r\ndiversifies life and appears a light and charming adventure, inevitably\r\ngrows into a regular problem of extreme intricacy, and in the long run\r\nthe situation becomes unbearable. But at every fresh meeting with an\r\ninteresting woman this experience seemed to slip out of his memory, and\r\nhe was eager for life, and everything seemed simple and amusing.\r\n\r\nOne evening he was dining in the gardens, and the lady in the _béret_\r\ncame up slowly to take the next table. Her expression, her gait, her\r\ndress, and the way she did her hair told him that she was a lady, that\r\nshe was married, that she was in Yalta for the first time and alone, and\r\nthat she was dull there.... The stories told of the immorality in such\r\nplaces as Yalta are to a great extent untrue; he despised them, and knew\r\nthat such stories were for the most part made up by persons who would\r\nthemselves have been glad to sin if they had been able; but when the\r\nlady sat down at the next table three paces from him, he remembered\r\nthese tales of easy conquests, of trips to the mountains, and the\r\ntempting thought of a swift, fleeting love affair, a romance with an\r\nunknown woman, whose name he did not know, suddenly took possession of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe beckoned coaxingly to the Pomeranian, and when the dog came up to him\r\nhe shook his finger at it. The Pomeranian growled: Gurov shook his\r\nfinger at it again.\r\n\r\nThe lady looked at him and at once dropped her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"He doesn't bite,\" she said, and blushed.\r\n\r\n\"May I give him a bone?\" he asked; and when she nodded he asked\r\ncourteously, \"Have you been long in Yalta?\"\r\n\r\n\"Five days.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I have already dragged out a fortnight here.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a brief silence.\r\n\r\n\"Time goes fast, and yet it is so dull here!\" she said, not looking at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"That's only the fashion to say it is dull here. A provincial will live\r\nin Belyov or Zhidra and not be dull, and when he comes here it's 'Oh,\r\nthe dulness! Oh, the dust!' One would think he came from Grenada.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed. Then both continued eating in silence, like strangers, but\r\nafter dinner they walked side by side; and there sprang up between them\r\nthe light jesting conversation of people who are free and satisfied, to\r\nwhom it does not matter where they go or what they talk about. They\r\nwalked and talked of the strange light on the sea: the water was of a\r\nsoft warm lilac hue, and there was a golden streak from the moon upon\r\nit. They talked of how sultry it was after a hot day. Gurov told her\r\nthat he came from Moscow, that he had taken his degree in Arts, but had\r\na post in a bank; that he had trained as an opera-singer, but had given\r\nit up, that he owned two houses in Moscow.... And from her he learnt\r\nthat she had grown up in Petersburg, but had lived in S---- since her\r\nmarriage two years before, that she was staying another month in Yalta,\r\nand that her husband, who needed a holiday too, might perhaps come and\r\nfetch her. She was not sure whether her husband had a post in a Crown\r\nDepartment or under the Provincial Council--and was amused by her own\r\nignorance. And Gurov learnt, too, that she was called Anna Sergeyevna.\r\n\r\nAfterwards he thought about her in his room at the hotel--thought she\r\nwould certainly meet him next day; it would be sure to happen. As he got\r\ninto bed he thought how lately she had been a girl at school, doing\r\nlessons like his own daughter; he recalled the diffidence, the\r\nangularity, that was still manifest in her laugh and her manner of\r\ntalking with a stranger.
